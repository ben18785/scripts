    POST INTERVIEW STONING - EVENING

    Sean enters wearing a suit, looking sharp, but a little 
    rough around the edges.

                            SEAN
                    Hey guys.

                            DOUGIE
                    Hey man, come and try out the new 
            Oboe.

                            SEAN
                    Where the fuck did you get an Oboe 
            from? Isn’t that Nils’?

                            DOUGIE
                    I won it off him in a bet. I bet 
            him he couldn’t whack off to finish 
            whilst we played The Lion King 
            Soundtrack outside his room. To his 
            credit he lost.

                            SEAN
                    Haha. Amazing. (Taking the Oboe) 
            You know wind instruments remind me 
            of this girl, Sarah, in middle 
            school? Seeing her blow down a 
            cylinder gave half the class hard 
            ons.

                            DOUGIE
                         (Lauging)

                    Awesome. My middle school days were 
            divided between mono and avoiding 
            showing my pube forest whenever we 
            showered for gym class.

                            TONE
                    So you were a retard repeating 
            grades at age 13 too?

                            DOUGIE
                    You fucking dick. [He's actually 
            annoyed] I’ve told you a million 
            times the reason I’m of greater age 
            than you is that I spent the first 
            four years of college clearing up 
            with girls, and missing class 
            because of extended sex sessions.

                            TONE
                    Sure. Sure. I forgot you had a 
            face-off-quality facial transplant 
            with a Lyndon B Johnson before you 
            met us.

                            DOUGIE
                    LBJ? Better than a fat, cross-eyed, 
            masturbatory resident of Moordor 
            you fuck.

                            SEAN
                (Picking up the Oboe)
                    Haha. Let me try it. 

                            TONE
                    You need to finger A minor to get 
            it to work.

                            DOUGIE
                    Shut up you fuck. 

                (He's high when he says 
                this)
                    Just ‘blow forest’…. ‘blow’

    Smoke starts to come out of the end of the Oboe, and all 
    three start laughing.

                            SEAN
                    That’s fucking awesome. ‘Amadeus’ 
            would have been much better if the 
            wood section used these.

                            DOUGIE
                (Laughing)
                    Yeah. Totally. 

                            TONE
                    Why the fuck you dressed like a 
            paedophilic civil servant?

                            SEAN
                    I’ve told your forgetful stoner 
            arse, like ten times, you dick. I’m 
            interviewing all week. Something 
            you seem to have avoided. Moordor 
            is operating in times of full 
            employment it seems. 

                            DOUGIE
                (In the voice of 
                Gollum/Elrond/Gandalf)
                    The 'all seeing eye' has guaranteed 
            him a job.

                            TONE
                    Least I've got a job for next year 
            you prick.

                            DOUGIE
                    Like your piss-ant job in 
            accountancy is anything to brag 
            about.

                            TONE
                    Well. Fuck-me-sideways sisters, as 
            I didn't tell you I'm going to be 
            James Liu's boss next year?

                            SEAN
                    What? How the fuck could you be 
            anyone's boss? You're just 
            starting.

                            TONE
                    Well, I'm starting in the high net 
            worth section. Well known 
            pan-accountancy to be the best 
            department in tax. Liuy is starting 
            in audit. Well known to be the 
            lowest of the low. Ergo, I will be 
            senior to him come September.

                            DOUGIE
                    Are you fucking kidding? You're not 
            even going to be in the same 
            department. You can't just claim to 
            be his boss, just because you think 
            your department is better.

                            TONE
                    Well everyone in E&Y thinks it's 
            true. 

                            DOUGIE
                    You fucking imbecile. Every time I 
            get my hopes up that you are less 
            of a dick than you used to be, you 
            just come in and surpass all 
            expectations. You previously had 
            only climbed the Mount Washington 
            of dicks, now you've taken on 
            Oxygen and moved onto Everest.

                            TONE
                    I'm sorry I've managed to get my 
            life together. Sorry I've not spent 
            my last 10 years switching majors, 
            masturbating, and playing Tiger 
            Woods. Sorry, I haven't been 
            rejected by every single 
            shit-fucked-up company out there.

                            DOUGIE
                    Fuck off you pap smear. Independent 
            of that latest news bollocken, you 
            still can't claim to be Liu's boss. 
            He's just in a different part of 
            the company to you. Mickey Mouse 
            and Donald duck don't end up 
            fighting since one of them's in 
            Ducktale's, the other in Fantasia.

                            TONE
                    You duck-fucker.

                            DOUGIE
                    Anyway, I didn’t get the OC&C gig. 
            Feedback from the interview was 
            that I didn’t have enough 
            experience.

                            TONE
                    Yeah, I never got that experience 
            shit. It’s like cancelling gym 
            class for Jewish kids, then 
            complaining that there aren’t any 
            Jews in baseball.

                            DOUGIE
                    There aren’t any Jews in baseball 
            anyway you dick.

                            SEAN
                    True. I just keep getting asked all 
            these bullshit questions. Like, 
            ‘Tell me a time where you succeeded 
            against all odds’.

                            TONE
                    You got laid once didn’t you?

                            SEAN
                    Yeah, one more time than you right? 
            Anyway, I ended up making up some 
            bullshit answer about how I 
            organised a college talent concert. 

                            TONE
                    You fucking hate talent 
            competitions!

                            SEAN
                    Yeah. Have no idea why I spun that 
            web. They just kept asking me what 
            was so hard about it. All I could 
            say, over and over again, was like, 
            ‘It was the wires…just so many 
            wires…haha…like more wires than you 
            can imagine...’ I sounded like a 
            failed cable engineer.

    Dougie and Tone start play acting. Tone lies down on the 
    table as if he’s Frankenstein’s monster. Dougie starts to 
    ‘operate’ on him using spoons, forks, etc.

                            DOUGIE
                    I’m nearly there…one more thing and 
            my work will be complete. I will 
            have created my exact likeness; 
            animated the inanimate; created 
            life! It’s (nearly) alive…

    He grabs a few wires from the playstation and ‘inserts’ them 
    under Tone. Sean is laughing whilst they do all of this.

                            DOUGIE
                    The only thing is, Where the hell 
            did these wires come from? Shit. 
            Where the hell does this go? So 
            many fucking wires! Is it from his 
            brain? Did I forget to connect his 
            arms? Oh, I see. His cock is 
            unbiologically small. I must have 
            forgotten to connect it when I did 
            his balls.

                            TONE
                    I think you must be confusing my 
            leg again. You are so used to your 
            tiny pecker that you think it’s a 
            fucking mamba when you see it.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing)
                    Your bent cock is more like a 
            seahorse than a snake to be honest.

    Tone and Dougie sit up again.

                            DOUGIE
                    Well fuck it. You’ll get something 
            man. If this spindle-dicked fuck 
            can bag a job, so can we. In the 
            meantime, pass the Oboe so I can 
            practice my scales.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing)
                    Yeah…I definitely could do with 
            improving my B flat major scale.

    Montage scene of them all getting high, and doing fucking 
    random shit. Try and have a scene of them doing salom-esq 
    trials down the stairs on a pair of roller skates.

    

    HUNGOVER WITH VICKY - MORNING

    Sean is lying asleep face down on his bed wearing only a 
    pair of roller skates and a tutu.

                            VICKY
                    Sean.

                            SEAN
                (Moans)
                    Aaaaarrgghh.

                            VICKY
                (Leaning closer to Sean, 
                so that her face is next 
                to his)
                    Sean!

                            SEAN
                (Moaning louder and still 
                obviously out of it; 
                dreaming)
                    What does the heron king want?

                    

                            VICKY
                    What? Sean, get up for fuck's sake.

                            SEAN
                (Looking at Vicky for the 
                first time with his eyes 
                open)
                    Oh. Hey Vix. How's it going? What 
            do you want?

                            VICKY
                    Not good. Not good at all. Bad. 
            I've got an interview for Clifford 
            Chance, in like two days, and I 
            can't remember my fucking interview 
            speech. You promised me you'd go 
            through it today! Where were you 
            this morning?

                            SEAN
                (Sitting up, wiping some 
                of the sweat off his 
                forehead, and realising 
                he has skates on)
                    Errm. The boys and me stayed up to 
            watch the election build up last 
            night. Think we lost track of time.

                            VICKY
                    So why are you wearing a tutu? 

                            SEAN
                    I think it something to do with 
            satirising the Republican candidate 
            for Delaware.

                            VICKY
                (Not impressed but 
                starting to be won over 
                by Sean's predicament)
                    And the skates?

                            SEAN
                    There's no rational explanation for 
            them. We were doing house Super G.

                            VICKY
                (Now smiling)
                    Well. Fuck. I had no idea you were 
            so busy today. If I had known I 
            would have come round after the 
            morning's skiing was over.

                            SEAN
                    That's ok. The snow's been a little 
            unpredictable for this year's 
            season. You weren't to know. Sorry 
            babe.

                            VICKY
                (Laughing)
                    That's ok Bodi Miller. Shit. How'd 
            it go yesterday with OC&C?

                            SEAN
                (Perking up a bit, trying 
                to put on a bit of a 
                positive show for Vicky)
                    Not too bad, yeah good actually.

                    

                            VICKY
                (Obviously interested in 
                this)
                    Yeah?

                            SEAN
                    And they liked the junior 
            entrepreneur stuff I did last year.

                    

                             VICKY
                    That's awesome. Well done babe.

                            SEAN
                (Perking up more, putting 
                on more of a show)
                    And they loved the case study 
            stuff. I mean I really nailed it!

                            VICKY
                    Amazing! So when do you hear about 
            it?

                            SEAN
                    Errm. I mean they already told me I 
            didn't get it.

                            VICKY
                (Confused)
                    What?! But I thought you said it 
            went well?

                            SEAN
                    It did. It did. It was going really 
            well until they started with all 
            the interpersonal shit. Like, how 
            am I supposed to know what 'the 
            most significant moment of my life 
            was'? Like if they ask me questions 
            like that, that's pretty much a 
            guaranteed 100% that I don't want 
            to work there right? They didn't 
            make my selection. Fuck it that I 
            didn't make theirs. They didn't 
            make mine.

                            VICKY
                (Quietly, not finding his 
                rhetoric convincing)
                    They all ask those interpersonal 
            questions.

                            SEAN
                    Well. Maybe I don't want to work 
            anywhere that values that sort of 
            crap.

                            VICKY
                (Dispairing)
                    Sean, you need to stop hanging out 
            with your housemates. They're 
            wasting your potential.

                            SEAN
                (Cringes when he hears 
                the word potential)
                    What? Can you stop with this 
            bullshit already? They've got 
            nothing to do with my temporary 
            inability to get a job.

                            VICKY
                    Then why have you spent more time 
            smoking pot recently than you have 
            prepping for interviews?

                            SEAN
                    There's only so much I can do. 
            Like, I spent all last week filling 
            out fucking bullshit 
            questionnaires, personal 
            statements, and doing cell 
            interviews with automata only 2 
            years my senior. Give me a fuckin 
            break.

                            VICKY
                (Now perhaps realising 
                that she has gone too far 
                today)
                    Sorry. Babe. I just don't want to 
            see you piss away your life when 
            you have so much to offer the 
            world. I just see so so much good 
            in you, that I would hate to see 
            you waste it all. I mean Doug isn't 
            even in his 20s anymore, and he 
            still hasn't graduated! Don't you 
            think that's a bit sad?

                            SEAN
                (Defensively, starting to 
                turn away from Vicky)
                    You know that's because he caught 
            mono in his softmore year? You 
            can't blame that shit on him.

                            VICKY
                (Looking him in the eyes, 
                grabbing his hands)
                    Ok. Ok. Sorry. I didn't mean to 
            bust up your friends. I just, I 
            mean, I just love you Sean, and I 
            want the best for you. Listen, I 
            won't bring up your friends 
            anymore, and I just know that you 
            are absolutely going to nail the 
            next interview. [Pause] I'm sure of 
            it.

                            SEAN
                    You think so?

                            VICKY
                    Definitely, 100%. I mean who 
            wouldn't want the only black slope 
            thrashing, cross-dressing, 
            beachside skier in LA.

                            SEAN
                    Shall we go and grab some lunch at 
            Dani's (a bar)?

                            VICKY
                (Kissing Sean)
                    Sure. Sounds good to me champ.

                            
    DANI'S BAR SCENE - THE NEXT DAY

    Sean and his housemates Tone, and Nils are sitting outside 
    smoking, drinking beer. Dougie is not there.

                            NILS
                    Have you guys ever noticed how 
            Indiana Jones basically has no plot 
            influence in Raiders?

                            SEAN
                    No way. Fuck. Really?

                            NILS
                    Yeah. Jones starts out in Peru 
            trying to steal something from the 
            Incas. Completely plot unrelated. 
            He travels to the Himalayas, meets 
            the girl...what's her name?

                            SEAN
                    The actress? No fucking idea.

                            NILS
                    No the character....Mary?

                            TONE
                    It's Martha isn't it. 100%.

                            NILS
                    No it's not. There is no character 
            in Indiana Jones called 'Marhta'. 
            You know fucking nothing about 
            movies, apart from that Middle 
            Earth Trilogy you starred in.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing)
                    Nice. 

                (Looking at Tone)
                    Hey, come on man. Don't be 
            'precious' about it.

                            TONE
                (Unimpressed)
                    It's definitely Martha. I'm sure 
            about it.

                            NILS
                    Nope. It's not. I'll Google it.

                    Beer and one eighth says it's 
            Martha.

                            NILS
                    Done. Just let me...

                (He's still typing away

                phone and have a look)
                    Wikipedia? It was probably written 
            by a 13 year old kid from 
            Bangladesh.

                    No 'old chap'. IMDB announces the 
            winner. No room for 
            non-professional authorship here. 
            Hand over the narcotics. I'll take 
            a beer next time Dani's in earshot.

                    Anyway, he meets this girl Marion.

                            TONE
                    Does anyone give a shit about this 
            story?

                            SEAN
                    Yeah. To be fair Nils this better 
            be Old Man and the Sea with this 
            build up.

                            NILS
                    Hemingway didn't have to deal with 
            this sort of bullshit. So he meets 
            this girl, Marion. Jones and the 
            broad get accosted by Nazis. They 
            escape. They travel to Egypt. They 
            find the Nazis, and the grail. The 
            two of them get caught, and get put 
            in a room with a shit ton of 
            snakes. 

                            SEAN
                    Classic Nazi kit.

                            TONE
                    Yep. Very typical.

                            NILS
                    So they escape. Jones finds the 
            Arc. Puts it on a boat for London. 
            Nazis retake the boat, along with 
            Jones and girl. Go to the Grecian 
            island they were originally aiming 
            for. They open the box. Faces melt. 
            Good guys win. Jones fails to 
            influence the outcome in any way.

                            TONE
                    I fucking love that part. There's 
            something about a Nazi face-melting 
            that just warms the heart's 
            cockles.

                            SEAN
                    What's this place?

                            TONE
                    Think it's a publisher. Somewhere 
            downtown. Can't remember its name.

                            SEAN
                    I didn't know he was still trying 
            with those guys? I thought everyone 
            had already passed, like 5 times, 
            on his musical horror?

                            NILS
                    He's moved on it seems. Weirdly, 
            he's actually interviewing with 
            them for a graduate editorial 
            position.

                            SEAN
                    Fuck. Shit. Good for him. 
            Obviously, we never tell him that, 
            but shit, good on him.

                            NILS
                    Yeah, careful Sean, you'll be the 
            only one left if he nails it.

                            SEAN
                    Without sounding pompous, and of 
            course I want him to nail it. It's 
            like his first interview. He's 
            older than most of the faculty. I 
            wish I weren't aware of some of the 
            places he has bodily hair. I mean, 
            this place would be fucking insane 
            if they took him.

                            NILS
                    I don't know man. He's taken it 
            seriously though. He even showered 
            and shit.

                            TONE
                    He wouldn't shower for his own 
            wedding. This is serious.

                    

                            SEAN 
                    Should we contact his parents? Call 
            the university welfare officer? Get 
            them to bring along the men with 
            white coats?

                            NILS
                    I think the only solution is to get 
            him absolutely baked and tell us 
            all about how he spent the 
            interview itching his left 
            knut-sack.

            I've never seem him take a taxi, I 
            mean the guy hasn't enough money to 
            cover his pop tart fetish.

                Nils. Starting to smile.)
                    How is the left arm that Simba 
            wished he had when he was nailing 
            Narla? Tone told me it was a dry 
            monsoon, once in a lifetime type 
            affair.

                            NILS
                (Laughing.)
                    Keep it fucking down man. Don't 
            want anyone else to hear about it.

                            DOUGIE
                (Speaking louder, 
                announcing this to the 
                table next door which is 
                full of girls.)
                    Hey guys. Like, do you like Disney 
            movies?

                            GIRLS
                (Speak amongst 
                themselves, and are 
                really shy.)
                    Like, is this some sort of pick up 
            line?

                            DOUGIE
                    It kind of depends how much you 
            like cartoons.

                            GIRLS
                (At least one of them 
                speaks up, and might 
                ostensibly be interested 
                in engaging with them.)
                    I mean probably the Little 
            Mermaid...No Aladdin. Best music 
            ever.

                            DOUGIE
                (Nils is trying to shut 
                him up the whole time 
                here. Shhing him etc.)
                    I mean. How much do you like 
            character Aladdin?

                            GIRLS
                    I mean he's ok, but I always liked 
            the genie.

                            DOUGIE
                (Excitedly, as he now has 
                them hooked.)
                    Ok. The genie. He's your fave. I 
            mean do you like him more than 
            like, your boyfriend?

                            GIRLS
                    I don't have a boyfriend. But if I 
            did, maybe. Depends if he has any 
            magical powers?

                            DOUGIE
                    Ok. Do you think you would make out 
            with him if he were real?

                            GIRLS
                    That's a fucking weird question. 
            Errm. I suppose if he were real, 
            and if he had 'magical' powers, I 
            might.

                            DOUGIE
                (Nils is burying his head 
                in his hands at this 
                point.)
                    What about if he were still a 
            cartoon? 

                    

                            GIRLS 
                    What? That'd be fucking weird. How 
            would I make out with him anyway? 
            Kiss the TV?

                            DOUGIE
                    No. But you could brain-fuck the 
            genie right? 

                            GIRLS
                    That's fucking weird. Is this going 
            anywhere?

                            DOUGIE
                    No. Don't worry. No offense meant. 
            We just had to settle a bet. Sorry 
            for disturbing you lovely ladies.

    Dougie now sits back down, and everyone looks kind of 
    relieved. Especially Nils.

                            NILS
                    Thank fuck for that. You fucking 
            asshole. As well as making me 
            physically fucking sick, you scared 
            the shit out of those girls. You, 
            not me, are the sick fuck.

                            DOUGIE
                (Starts to say something, 
                but is interrupted by the 
                girl he was conversing 
                with.)
                            GIRLS
                    Like, I don't know where you got 
            that weed from, but, we are about 
            to head to this party. Think 
            there's going to be a keg, probably 
            girls which are too good for three 
            quarters of you, but....if you 
            could get us some of that shit 
            you've been smoking maybe we could 
            sort you out with a ride.

                            DOUGIE
                    Let me ask my fellow cabinet 
            ministers. Guys, what'd you think, 
            sounds good to me?

                            TONE, SEAN, NILS
                (In agreement, they nod, 
                and generally give their 
                answers positively.)
                            DOUGIE
                    Let's hit this shit.

                            
    CAR SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

    The girls in the back are sandwiched by the guys nearest the 
    car doors. Tone is in the boot. Dougie is laughing, sitting 
    in the front seat, talking and laughing with the girl whom 
    he was conversing before. He's making some sort of joint 
    with a big bag of weed strewn out on his lap. Nils and Sean 
    are looking a bit sheepish, especially Sean who is next to a 
    larger girl who seems enraptured by him, and is nausing him 
    off. Nils is trying to speak with one of the hotter two, but 
    is being interrupted by Tone from behind them.

    HUNGOVER FROM PARTY - MORNING AFTER

    The guys (Tone, Sean and Nils) are draped over the couches 
    in their sitting room, the whole place is a fucking mess. 
    The guys are woken up by Dougie walking around in his 
    dressing gown, making the girl a full breakfast; they are 
    both laughing away. He wakes them up explictly by asking 
    them all (uncharacteristically) whether they want tea. Sean 
    leaves to go and do something obscure. The girl is left with 
    the other guys, and seems at ease. Nils asks her a question 
    about her fit mate, she gets uppity and makes a comment 
    about his Lion King masturbatory habits, and leaves, leaving 
    her number for Dougie. Amusing confrontation between Nils 
    and Dougie when he comes back down. Dougie then tells them 
    nonchalantly about the job offer he got yesterday. I think 
    it could be in response to someone asking him what's next in 
    the job hunt. Says it was the reason he got so baked. In 
    celebration. The other two guys get up and congratulate him, 
    shaking his hand etc. The camera zooms into Sean's face and 
    it is clear he is panicked. The guys ask him if everything 
    is ok, and say something like 'you look as if you are about 
    to vom'. Or that he looks like Sigourney Weaver in Aliens 3. 
    He runs upstairs. Locks his room. Lies on his bed. Montage 
    as Sean starts to panickedly fill out applications.
