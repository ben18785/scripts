    INTERVIEW MONTAGE SCENE - INTERVIEWING AND FUCKING ABOUT AT 
    HOME

    Split screen between Sean's efforts to interview, and his 
    life at his house with his mates. 

    POST INTERVIEW STONING - EVENING

    Sean enters wearing a suit, looking sharp, but a little 
    rough around the edges.

                            SEAN
                    Hey guys.

                            DOUGIE
                    Hey man, come and try out the new 
            Oboe.

                            SEAN
                    Where the fuck did you get an Oboe 
            from? Isn’t that Nils’?

                            DOUGIE
                    I won it off him in a bet. I bet 
            him he couldn’t whack off to finish 
            whilst we played The Lion King 
            Soundtrack outside his room. To his 
            credit he lost.

                            SEAN
                    Haha. Amazing. (Taking the Oboe) 
            You know wind instruments remind me 
            of this girl, Sarah, in middle 
            school? Seeing her blow down a 
            cylinder gave half the class hard 
            ons.

                            DOUGIE
                         (Lauging)

                    Awesome. My middle school days were 
            divided between pogs and trying to 
            avoid showing my pube forest 
            whenever we showered for gym class.

                            TONE
                    So you were a retard repeating 
            grades at age 13 too?

                            DOUGIE
                    You fucking dick. [He's actually 
            annoyed] I’ve told you a million 
            times I'm a bit older was 'cause I 
            caught mono off this hot chick in 
            my first year.

                            TONE
                    Sure. Sure. I forgot you had a 
            face-off-quality facial transplant 
            with a Lyndon B Johnson before you 
            met us.

                            DOUGIE
                    LBJ? Better than a fat, cross-eyed, 
            masturbatory resident of Moordor 
            you fuck.

                            SEAN
                (Picking up the Oboe)
                    Haha. Let me try it. 

                            TONE
                    You need to finger A minor to get 
            it to work.

                            DOUGIE
                    Shut up you fuck. 

                (He's high when he says 
                this)
                    Just ‘blow forest’…. ‘blow’

    Smoke starts to come out of the end of the Oboe, and all 
    three start laughing.

                            SEAN
                    That’s fucking awesome. ‘Amadeus’ 
            would have been much better if the 
            wood section used these.

                            DOUGIE
                (Laughing)
                    Yeah. Totally. 

                            TONE
                    Why the fuck you dressed like a 
            paedophilic civil servant?

                            SEAN
                    I’ve told your forgetful stoner 
            arse, like ten times, you dick. I’m 
            interviewing all week. Something 
            you seem to have avoided. Moordor 
            is operating in times of full 
            employment it seems. 

                            DOUGIE
                (In the voice of 
                Gollum/Elrond/Gandalf)
                    The 'all seeing eye' has guaranteed 
            him a job.

                            TONE
                    Least I've got a job for next year 
            you prick.

                            DOUGIE
                    Like your piss-ant job in 
            accountancy is anything to brag 
            about.

                            TONE
                    Well. Fuck-me-sideways sisters, as 
            I didn't tell you I'm going to be 
            James Liu's boss next year?

                            SEAN
                    What? How the fuck could you be 
            anyone's boss? You're just 
            starting.

                            TONE
                    Well, I'm starting in the high net 
            worth section. Well known 
            pan-accountancy to be the best 
            department in tax. Liuy is starting 
            in audit. Well known to be the 
            lowest of the low. Ergo, I will be 
            senior to him come September.

                            DOUGIE
                    Are you fucking kidding? You're not 
            even going to be in the same 
            department. You can't just claim to 
            be his boss, just because you think 
            your department is better.

                            TONE
                    Well everyone in E&Y thinks it's 
            true. 

                            DOUGIE
                    You fucking imbecile. Every time I 
            get my hopes up that you are less 
            of a dick than you used to be, you 
            just come in and surpass all 
            expectations. You had previously 
            only climbed the Mount Washington 
            of dicks, now you've taken on 
            Oxygen and moved onto the 
            Himalayas. 

                            TONE
                    I'm sorry I've managed to get my 
            life together. Sorry I've not spent 
            my last 10 years switching majors, 
            masturbating, and playing Tiger 
            Woods. Sorry, I haven't been 
            rejected by every single 
            shit-fucked-up company out there.

                            DOUGIE
                    Fuck off you pap smear.

                            TONE
                    You duck-fucker.

                            SEAN
                    Anyway, I didn’t get the OC&C gig. 
            Feedback from the interview was 
            that I didn’t have enough 
            experience.

                            TONE
                    Yeah, I never got that experience 
            shit. It’s like cancelling gym 
            class for Jewish kids, then 
            complaining that there aren’t any 
            Jews in baseball.

                            DOUGIE
                    There aren’t any Jews in baseball 
            anyway you dick.

                            SEAN
                    True. I just keep getting asked all 
            these bullshit questions. Like, 
            ‘Tell me a time where you succeeded 
            against all odds’.

                            TONE
                    You got laid once didn’t you?

                            SEAN
                    Yeah, one more time than you right? 
            Anyway, I ended up making up some 
            bullshit answer about how I 
            organised a college talent concert. 

                            TONE
                    You fucking hate talent 
            competitions!

                            SEAN
                    Yeah. Have no idea why I spun that 
            web. They just kept asking me what 
            was so hard about it. All I could 
            say, over and over again, was like, 
            ‘It was the wires…just so many 
            wires…haha…like more wires than you 
            can imagine...’ I sounded like a 
            failed cable engineer.

    Dougie and Tone start play acting. Tone lies down on the 
    table as if he’s Frankenstein’s monster. Dougie starts to 
    ‘operate’ on him using spoons, forks, etc.

                            DOUGIE
                    I’m nearly there…one more thing and 
            my work will be complete. I will 
            have created my exact likeness; 
            animated the inanimate; created 
            life! It’s (nearly) alive…

    He grabs a few wires from the playstation and ‘inserts’ them 
    under Tone. Sean is laughing whilst they do all of this.

                            DOUGIE
                    The only thing is, Where the hell 
            did these wires come from? Shit. 
            Where the hell does this go? So 
            many fucking wires! Is it from his 
            brain? Did I forget to connect his 
            arms? Oh, I see. His cock is 
            unbiologically small. I must have 
            forgotten to connect it when I did 
            his balls.

                            TONE
                    I think you must be confusing my 
            leg again. You are so used to your 
            tiny pecker that you think it’s a 
            fucking mamba when you see it.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing)
                    Your bent cock is more like a 
            seahorse than a snake to be honest.

    Tone and Dougie sit up again.

                            DOUGIE
                    Well fuck it. You’ll get something 
            man. If this spindle-dicked fuck 
            can bag a job, so can we. In the 
            meantime, pass the Oboe so I can 
            practice my scales.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing)
                    Yeah…I definitely could do with 
            improving my B flat major scale.

    Montage scene of them all getting high, and doing fucking 
    random shit. Try and have a scene of them doing salom-esq 
    trials down the stairs on a pair of roller skates.

    

    HUNGOVER WITH VICKY - MORNING

    Sean is lying asleep face down on his bed wearing only a 
    pair of roller skates and a tutu.

                            VICKY
                    Sean.

                            SEAN
                (Moans)
                    Aaaaarrgghh.

                            VICKY
                (Leaning closer to Sean, 
                so that her face is next 
                to his)
                    Sean!

                            SEAN
                (Moaning louder and still 
                obviously out of it; 
                dreaming)
                    What does the heron king want?

                    

                            VICKY
                    What? Sean, get up for fuck's sake.

                            SEAN
                (Looking at Vicky for the 
                first time with his eyes 
                open)
                    Oh. Hey Vix. How's it going? What 
            do you want?

                            VICKY
                    Not good. Not good at all. Bad. 
            I've got an interview for Clifford 
            Chance, in like two days, and I 
            can't remember my fucking interview 
            speech. You promised me you'd go 
            through it today! Where were you 
            this morning?

                            SEAN
                (Sitting up, wiping some 
                of the sweat off his 
                forehead, and realising 
                he has skates on)
                    Errm. The boys and me stayed up to 
            watch the election build up last 
            night. Think we lost track of time.

                            VICKY
                    So why are you wearing a tutu? 

                            SEAN
                    I think it had something to do with 
            satirising the Republican candidate 
            for Delaware.

                            VICKY
                (Not impressed but 
                starting to be won over 
                by Sean's predicament)
                    And the skates?

                            SEAN
                    There's no rational explanation for 
            them. We were doing house Super G.

                            VICKY
                (Now smiling)
                    Well. Fuck. I had no idea you were 
            so busy today. If I had known I 
            would have come round after the 
            morning's skiing was over.

                            SEAN
                    That's ok. The snow's been a little 
            unpredictable for this year's 
            season. You weren't to know. Sorry 
            babe.

                            VICKY
                (Laughing)
                    That's ok Bodi Miller. Shit. How'd 
            it go yesterday with OC&C?

                            SEAN
                (Perking up a bit, trying 
                to put on a bit of a 
                positive show for Vicky)
                    Not too bad, yeah good actually.

                    

                            VICKY
                (Obviously interested in 
                this)
                    Yeah?

                            SEAN
                    Yeah. And they liked the junior 
            entrepreneur stuff I did last year.

                    

                             VICKY
                    That's awesome. Well done babe.

                            SEAN
                (Perking up more, putting 
                on more of a show)
                    And they loved the case study 
            stuff. I mean I really nailed it!

                            VICKY
                    Amazing! So when do you hear about 
            it?

                            SEAN
                    Errm. I mean they already told me I 
            didn't get through.

                            VICKY
                (Confused)
                    What?! But I thought you said it 
            went well?

                            SEAN
                    It did. It did. It was going really 
            well until they started with all 
            the interpersonal shit. Like, how 
            am I supposed to know what 'the 
            most significant moment of my life 
            was'? Like if they ask me questions 
            like that, that's pretty much a 
            guaranteed 100% that I don't want 
            to work there right? They didn't 
            make my selection. Fuck it that I 
            didn't make theirs. They didn't 
            make mine.

                            VICKY
                (Quietly, not finding his 
                rhetoric convincing)
                    They all ask those interpersonal 
            questions.

                            SEAN
                    Well. Maybe I don't want to work 
            anywhere that values that sort of 
            crap.

                            VICKY
                (Dispairing)
                    Sean, you need to stop hanging out 
            with your housemates. They're 
            wasting your potential.

                            SEAN
                (Cringes when he hears 
                the word potential)
                    What? Can you stop with this 
            bullshit already? They've got 
            nothing to do with my temporary 
            inability to get a job.

                            VICKY
                    Then why have you spent more time 
            smoking pot recently than you have 
            prepping for interviews?

                            SEAN
                    There's only so much I can do. 
            Like, I spent all last week filling 
            out fucking bullshit 
            questionnaires, personal 
            statements, and doing cell 
            interviews with automata only 2 
            years my senior. Give me a fuckin 
            break.

                            VICKY
                (Now perhaps realising 
                that she has gone too far 
                today)
                    Sorry. Babe. I just don't want to 
            see you throw away your life when 
            you have so much to offer the 
            world. I just see so so much good 
            in you, that I would hate to see 
            you waste it all. I mean Doug isn't 
            even in his 20s anymore, and he 
            still hasn't graduated! Don't you 
            think that's a bit sad?

                            SEAN
                (Defensively, starting to 
                turn away from Vicky)
                    You know that's because he caught 
            mono in his softmore year? You 
            can't blame that shit on him.

                            VICKY
                (Looking him in the eyes, 
                grabbing his hands)
                    Ok. Ok. Sorry. I didn't mean to 
            bust up your friends. I just, I 
            mean, I just love you Sean, and I 
            want the best for you. Listen, I 
            won't bring up your friends 
            anymore, and I just know that you 
            are absolutely going to nail the 
            next interview. [Pause] I'm sure of 
            it.

                            SEAN
                    You think so?

                            VICKY
                    Definitely, 100%. I mean who 
            wouldn't want the only black slope 
            thrashing, cross-dressing, 
            beachside skier in LA.

                    Sure.

                            
    DANI'S BAR SCENE - THE NEXT DAY

                    Have you guys ever noticed how 
            Indiana Jones basically has no plot 
            influence in Raiders?

                            SEAN
                    No way. Fuck. Really?

                            NILS
                    Yeah. Jones starts out in Peru 
            trying to steal something from the 
            Incas. Completely plot unrelated. 
            He travels to the Himalayas, meets

                    No it's not. There is no character 
            in Indiana Jones called 'Martha'.

                    It's definitely Martha. I'm sure

                    I didn't know he was still trying

            older than most of the faculty. I

                (Saying to the other 
                three quietly, so that 
                Dougie can't hear it.)
                    Shit. Think it went badly guys. 
            I've never seem him take a taxi, I 
            mean the guy hasn't enough money to 
            cover his pop tart fetish.

                            NILS
                (Quietly)
                    Yeah, and look at his face, he's 
            clearly been 'toking'. 

                            
                (Louder now, looking at 
                Dougie)
                    Hey man, how'd it go? Want a beer, 
            I'm about to do a run?

                            DOUGIE
                (Clearly baked off his 
                face)
                    Fuck. Like, I took the bus back 
            from downtown. Got high with this 
            guy who was selling old cans on the 
            back of the bus. Like amazing 
            shiiit. Straight out of Peru.

                            SEAN
                (Looking at the others 
                kind of quizzically.)
                    Cool. Errrm. But how did the 
            interview go?

                            DOUGIE
                    Yeah, it was ok. I mean ok. I mean 
            it's fucking weird having to answer 
            questions and shit. You know?

                            SEAN
                    Yeah. Shit, sorry man.

                            DOUGIE
                    I mean, what is the fucking point 
            of that shiiit. 

                (Pausing. Looking at 
                Nils. Starting to smile.)
                    How is Simba's left paw? The dry 
            monsoon still continuing from 
            yesterday?

                            NILS
                (Laughing.)
                    Keep it fucking down man. Don't 
            want anyone else to hear about it.

                            DOUGIE
                (Speaking louder, 
                announcing this to the 
                table next door which is 
                full of girls.)
                    Hey guys. Like, do you like Disney 
            movies?

                            GIRLS
                (Speak amongst 
                themselves, who appear 
                originally shy)
                    Like, is this some sort of pick up 
            line?

                            DOUGIE
                    It kind of depends how much you 
            like cartoons.

                            GIRLS
                (At least one of them 
                speaks up, and might 
                ostensibly be interested 
                in engaging with them.)
                    I mean probably the Little 
            Mermaid...No Aladdin. Whole New 
            World. Like best music ever.

                            DOUGIE
                (Nils is trying to shut 
                him up the whole time 
                here. Shhing him etc.)
                    I mean. How much do you like 
            character Aladdin?

                            GIRLS
                    I mean he's ok, but I always liked 
            the genie.

                            DOUGIE
                (Excitedly, as he now has 
                her hooked.)
                    Ok. The genie. He's your fave. I 
            mean do you like him more than 
            like, your boyfriend?

                            GIRLS
                    I don't have a boyfriend. But if I 
            did, maybe. Depends if he has any 
            magical powers?

                            DOUGIE
                    Ok. Do you think you would make out 
            with him if he were real?

                            GIRLS
                    That's a fucking weird question. 
            Errm. I suppose if he were real, 
            and if he had 'magical' powers, I 
            might.

                            DOUGIE
                (Nils is burying his head 
                in his hands at this 
                point.)
                    What about if he were still a 
            cartoon? 

                            GIRLS
                (One of the girls says 
                sexily looking straight 
                at Dougie)
                    I'd probably fuck the shit out of 
            him. Cartoonistically. That is.

                            DOUGIE
                (Impressed.)
                    Shit. Ok.

                            GIRLS
                    Sorry, does that damage your 
            childhood Disney nostalgia?

                            DOUGIE
                (Impressed at the 
                forwardness of the girl)
                    No. I just. Errm. That's fucking 
            cool.

                    

    Dougie now sits back down, and everyone looks kind of 
    relieved. Especially Nils.

                            NILS
                    Thank fuck for that. You fucking 
            asshole. As well as making me 
            physically fucking sick, you scared 
            the shit out of those girls. You, 
            not me, are the sick fuck.

                            DOUGIE
                (Starts to say something, 
                but is interrupted by the 
                girl he was conversing 
                with.)
                            GIRLS
                    Like, I don't know where you got 
            that weed from, but, we are about 
            to head to this party. Think 
            there's going to be a keg, probably 
            girls which are too good for three 
            quarters of you, but....if you 
            could get us some of that shit 
            you've been smoking maybe we could 
            sort you out with a ride.

                            DOUGIE
                    Let me ask my fellow cabinet 
            ministers. Guys, what'd you think, 
            sounds good to me?

                            TONE, SEAN, NILS
                (In agreement, they nod, 
                and generally give their 
                answers positively.)
                            DOUGIE
                    Put on your overalls girls, as 
            we're about to hit this shit.

                            
    CAR SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

    The girls in the back are sandwiched by the guys nearest the 
    car doors. Tone is in the boot. Dougie is laughing, sitting 
    in the front seat, talking and laughing with the girl whom 
    he was conversing before. He's making some sort of joint 
    with a big bag of weed strewn out on his lap. Nils and Sean 
    are looking a bit sheepish, especially Sean who is next to a 
    larger girl who seems enraptured by him, and is nausing him 
    off. Nils is trying to speak with one of the hotter two, but 
    is being interrupted by Tone from behind them.

                            DOUGIE
                    Yeah, so you like study here?

                            GIRL 1
                    No, I'm over at UCLA, majoring in 
            psychology. 

                            DOUGIE
                    Ahh. Cool. Like I love that shit. 
            Like when I'm watching an advert 
            with Megan Fox drinking Mountain 
            Dew. 15 minutes later I find myself 
            in a 7/11, got 2 bucks in my 
            pocket, what am I going to spend it 
            on? I mean I don't even like the 
            stuff, but that's psychology for 
            you.

                            GIRL 1
                (Laughing.)
                    Yeah I mean I am just trying to 
            work out ways to sell shit 
            subliminally to people. 

                            DOUGIE
                    Ok. So we need to work out what to 
            start selling. What has a good 
            margin on it? Spiritual guidance of 
            some kind is pretty cheap to make. 
            Only thing is, can you actually 
            contact the dead?

                            GIRL 1
                    I think as much as John Edwards 
            can. Not as much as Hailey Joel 
            Osmond.

                            DOUGIE
                    Ok. I think that's enough 
            spirituality to make it work. 
            Actually I think there could be a 
            gap in the market. I mean there are 
            so many self-help gurus out there, 
            and shit loads of stuff for people 
            failing at life and shit. But, what 
            about a book that does the reverse? 
            Tells successful businessmen, 
            congressmen etc. which attributes 
            it takes to really suck at life?

                            GIRL 1
                    Yeah. A book aimed at reducing 
            societal inequality by bringing 
            down the overly smug.

                            GIRL 2
                (A little overweight, 
                obviously into Sean. 
                Looking at him.)
                    So, you know, I like Miley Cirus, 
            but I don't want to be her.

                            SEAN
                (Humouring, trying to be 
                a nice guy)
                    Yeah, I mean this twerking thing is 
            fucking weird. And it's now some 
            sort of 'meme'. A word that has now 
            lost all meaning due to its 
            adoption by the 
            smartphone-wielding, 
            predictive-texting, masses.

                    

                            GIRL 2
                (Not really understanding 
                Sean's point.)
                    Yeah, I mean that Harlem Shake 
            thing was good, but not AMAZING. 
            Much funnier was that planking 
            thing.

                            SEAN
                (Carrying on regardless 
                with his rant.)
                    Yeah. I mean here is a phrase 
            coined to try to understand why 
            some ideas are more tenacious than 
            others, borrowing on concepts from 
            Darwinian evolution, and now 13 
            year old kids are using it to 
            justify dancing topless outside the 
            Sagrada Familia. I mean it's all 
            just fucking media bollocks anyway. 
            Like I always think, 'when does a 
            person reported on in the news 
            transition from being injured, to 
            badly injured?' Is there like a 
            wall chart which divides up 
            injuries on the basis of 
            seriousness? Broken arm. Not 
            serious. Appendicitis. Unless 
            stoned, not serious. Paralysis. 
            Serious. 

                            GIRL 2
                    But I mean, like if someone is a 
            painter, a broken finger is 
            serious.

                            SEAN
                    Totally. I mean there's no way to 
            have an objective measure of injury 
            seriousness. It's all just media 
            pomp.

                            TONE
                (Talking to the hot girl 
                on the back left seat, 
                who's obviously not 
                interested.)
                    So, you know people always say, you 
            are what you eat?

                            NILS
                    Tone, why don't you just stop your 
            barking for once?

                (Turning to the 
                disinterested girl.)
                    I mean some guys are just so 
            insensitive you know?

                            TONE
                    Well, anyway you know how people 
            say you become whatever you eat too 
            much of?

                            NILS
                    If we ignore him long enough he'll 
            go away. He's like the cursor on a 
            laptop screen when you watch a 
            movie. If you leave him, he ceases 
            to be visible.

                            TONE
                    So, yeah. It's funny when people 
            say that, about embodying what you 
            eat. Cause I don't remember eating 
            a legend.

                (Laughing looking 
                straight at the girl from 
                the side.)
                    You get it? I mean I made that up 
            just now, on the spot.

                            GIRL 3
                (Completely uninterested, 
                and sarcastically.)
                    Yeah?

                            TONE
                    I mean I pretty much make up all my 
            own material. Not to brag, but some 
            people are just innately funny. You 
            know?

                            GIRL 3
                    Yeah. Your humour is pretty much on 
            a par with George Bernard Shaw in 
            terms of witty construction.

                            NILS
                (Laughing.)
                    Nice one sister.

                            GIRL 1
                (Speaking to everyone.)
                    Ok bitches. We're here. Welcome to 
            hell.

                (Car pulls up outside a 
                fraternity party.)
                    

    FRAT PARTY SCENE - NIGHT

    Dougie becomes a big hit at the party; pulling out his 
    guitar, and just hitting it off with everyone. The other 
    three just stay together and get smashed. The three are sat 
    round a table playing pyramid, coupled with mine/yours. The 
    idea behind the scene is that Sean finds out that Dougie has 
    a job, or perhaps Nils tells him about one of his childhood 
    idols who is an actor, which will give Sean advice later on. 
    Sean flips out, and gets really fucking drunk.

                            TONE
                    Mine. 

                (Looking at a girl across

                with a bunch of guys.)
                    Mine. That's a massive mine.

                walking past.)
                    We have proven gold deposits. 
            Someone construct a mine here.

                            NILS
                    You know the game doesn't really 
            work if your sole discriminatory 
            factor for deciding between mine 
            and yourses, is the sex of the 
            individual.

                            TONE
                    Well, at least I can discriminate 
            on that basis you camp-counselor. 
            If you competed in the Olympics 
            you'd be a BI-athlete.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing.)
                    Yeah, Nils, if you were a mode of 
            transport, you'd be a BI-cycle.

                    Ok you apes. Three of spades. Any 
            takers?

                            TONE
                    I call the homo gaypien. 

                            NILS
                    Tone, how the fuck do you think 
            you'll get away with that? We know 
            you don't have a three after that 
            call five minutes ago! Sometimes I 
            wonder whether your life isn't just 
            one long Memento-esq movie.

                            TONE
                    Shit. Fuck.

                (Drinks two fingers of 
                vodka.)
                            SEAN
                    Did I ever tell you how I used to 
            think that movie was shit?

                            NILS
                    No. How the fuck did you think 
            that? I mean Carrie Anne Moss, 
            could have probably been adequately 
            replaced by actual moss, but 
            otherwise it was pretty sound.

                            SEAN
                    Yeah. Well I watched it in the 
            temporally-correct order. There was 
            a DVD extra that allowed you to do 
            that. Let's just say it lacks some 
            of the suspense of the original 
            intended format.

                            NILS
                    Haha. That's fucking hilarious!

    They hear Dougie starting to sing from the other room.

                            NILS
                    Why does Dougie always kill it at 
            parties like this?

    They all turn and look at Dougie, through a doorway into the 
    other room where he is playing a guitar, making people 
    laugh.

                            SEAN
                    I think he's got a certain aura 
            about him. Especially on first 
            appearances. When I met him I just 
            thought, 'This guy's got 
            everything. He's witty, 
            intelligent, neyyy, a fucking 
            genius.'

    Whilst Sean is saying this Dougie starts mimick playing the 
    guitar with his cock. Strumming the strings with his balls. 
    All the guys start to wince, and look quizzical. 

                            NILS
                    Yeah.. Erm. Is he doing his cock 
            guitar thing?

                            
                            TONE
                    Yep. I think so. I didn't think 
            he'd pull that one out of the bag 
            for, at least, another seven shots.

                            SEAN
                    Yep. As I said. Then after the 
            initial idiot savant behaviour he 
            just turns into a cock-wielding 
            idiot.

                            
    Dougie is now dancing around the room, 'playing' the guitar 
    with his cock, nipple and ass. Other people are looking at 
    him sort of half laughing, half not-really-understanding.

                            SEAN
                    God help them. They're putty in his 
            hands.

                    Ok. I call Sean.

                            TONE
                    I call Sean too.

                            SEAN
                    Shit guys! That's like eight 
            fingers if I call you both. 
            [Pauses] Ok. Fuck it. I call the 
            two of 'yers.

                            TONE
                    Put that in your ass, and fuck it.

                            NILS
                    A bit less coarsely than this 
            gibbon, but I'm afraid Seany, the 
            result is the same. Time to take 
            your medicine.

                            TONE
                    Yep. See you tomorrow man.

    Sean starts to drink the eight fingers of vodka from a 
    bottle, obviously finding it hard going. Stopping halfway 
    through.

                            NILS
                    Come on man. Don't worry we'll try 
            to remember some anecdotes about 
            tonight to tell you in the morning. 
            Night night.

    Sean finishes the rest of the glass, and promptly walks 
    outside, to get some fresh air. He eventually finds himself 
    in the garden, and looks up at the stars. He closes his eyes 
    and starts to breathe more slowly, collecting himself. The 
    camera starts to mimic his vision now, with the world 
    spinning and blurring. He then walks back into the house 
    smiling drunkenly to himself to find both Tone and Nils with 
    their arms round Dougie, congratulating him.

                            TONE
                (Speaking to Dougie.)
                    Fuck that means we'll both be 
            downtown next year! We can do 
            business lunches, you know? Like, 
            have a beer on Friday lunchtimes.

                            DOUGIE
                    Shit yeah, that'll be fucking 
            awesome. 

                            NILS
                    I'm only a few blocks over. We can 
            do midweek, young professional, 
            beers at some grimy LA bar.

                            SEAN
                (A little out of it, so 
                not really grasping what 
                is happening.)
                    What's happening guys? What you 
            talking about?

                            NILS
                    Dougie got some news. Dougie, why 
            don't you fill in the dear boy?

                            DOUGIE
                    Yeah, like two minutes ago I was 
            smoking this fucking jurassic 
            doobie with this guy, Darren, and I 
            was like, 'How old was Michael 
            Jordan?'

    Dougie's eyes glaze over, and he is just looking off into 
    the distance. The rest of the guys look at him, and lean in 
    closer expecting him to say something, starting to look at 
    one another.

                            NILS
                    Errm. Dougie. Like, maybe you 
            should tell Seany about the job?

                            DOUGIE
                    Oh yeah. Fuck. That was gooooodd 
            weeed. Yeah, so I was smoking this 
            joint, then I gets a call from this 
            guy at the publisher, saying that 
            the graduate editor position was 
            now filled.

                            SEAN
                    Shit. Sorry man. Well I guess there 
            will be other interviews. Other 
            chances. You probably didn't want 
            it anyway right?

                            DOUGIE
                    Yeah. At first I was like. Shiiiit. 
            Then the guy on the phone says, 
            like even though the graduate job 
            has gone, they think I could just 
            walk into a more senior role (since 
            I am a bit more experienced). So 
            they offered me the position of 
            'Assistant Editor'! 

    Sean is now starting to glaze over as the gravity of 
    Dougie's news starts to sink in. The room starts to spin, 
    and the other guys are all staring at him.

                            NILS
                (Looking at Sean who has 
                gone catatonic.)

            go have a group xtube outing back

                    Ok. It's good that you're talking, 
            but I'm not sure whether 
            anthropomorphising alcohol is a 
            good or bad sign.

                pouring a massive glass 
                of vodka for himself, and

                    Eight fingers. Eight fingers.

    Downing the drink, then proceeding to pour himself another 
    huge drink.

                            DOUGIE
                    That's it big guy. Just let it out.

                offf Sean, but failing.)
                    Ok Seany, think it's time we got 
            outta here.

                            SEAN
                (Literally grabbing 
                everything around him 
                that looks remotely 
                drinkable.)
                    You wanna run? I wanna run!

    Sean starts to run around the house, grabbing every drink he 
    can and downing it.

                            FRAT BOY
                (Sean is taking the drink 
                away from the frat boy, 
                and downing it.)
                    What the fuck you doing you little 
            prick?

                            SEAN
                (Mimicking writing notes 
                with his hand.)

                chest.)
                    Yeah you little fagg.

                            SEAN
                (Still mimicking 
                writing.)
                    Oh shit. Sorry I didn't get that 
            last one. Could you repeat it?

                            FRAT BOY
                    Get the fuck outta here you little 
            shit. [Pause] What the fuck are you 
            doing?

                            SEAN
                (Still writing.)
                    Just making sure I get these 
            witisms written down. Jesus, this 
            stuff is genuine platinum comedy. 
            Woody Allen will probably want to 
            make a screenplay, you just wait by 
            your phone for the call.

    Sean now runs, grabs the guitar, starts to use it somehow as 
    a vessel to drink from. Perhaps pouring the drink into the 
    hole, then tipping the guitar upside down into his mouth.

    Nils, Dougie, Tone are all next to each other just staring 
    blankly at Sean's descent.

                            
                            NILS
                (Looking at Sean 
                quizzically.)
                    Shit. This is fuckin' nuts.

                            TONE
                    Yeah. Shall we intervene? I mean 
            he's pretty much asking for an ass 
            kicking.

                            DOUGIE
                (Still high, laughing.)
                    Shit, that was actually pretty 
            funny with that frat boy. Glad to 
            see that the kid has it.

                            NILS
                    Fuck it. He can be an asshole, 
            let's leave him to it.

    Sean runs past, now holding a salmon; flapping it in the 
    faces of Nils and Tone.

                            TONE
                    Where the fuck did he get a fish 
            from?

                            DOUGIE
                    Shit. Boy's resourcesful.

    Sean now starts to look a bit ill. And slows to a stop, then 
    runs up to a toilet, and voms into the beeday. Then just 
    passes out on the toilet floor, with salmon in hand still. 
    Camera fuzzes out.

                    

                    

                    

    HUNGOVER FROM PARTY - MORNING AFTER

    Sean is lying on the sofa just wearing his pants. He is 
    woken up by the pleasant sound of Dougie cooking the gil 
    from last night breakfast. They both sound jovial, and are 
    getting on like a house on fire.

                            DOUGIE
                (Speaking to Anna, the 
                girl.)
                    So, yeah. I don't exactly work out, 
            but you know, now and then I walk 
            all the way into the city. Just to 
            see the scenery, admire the 
            architecture, smoke the odd doobie?

    Sean is now kind of rubbing his eyes, not really 
    understanding what is going on, particularly finding it odd 
    that Sean is talking about architecture.

                            ANNA
                (Laughing.)
                    Well I normally just date jocks, 
            you know, guys on crew, baseball 
            pitchers, the quarterbacks. But, 
            maybe in your case - seeing as your 
            eggs benedict are quite so 
            excellent - I might be able to make 
            a small exception.

                            DOUGIE
                (Leaning over and kissing 
                Anna.)
                    Who said I wasn't a quarterback? I 
            can toss with the best of them you 
            know?

                (Now he sees Sean 
                starting to rise from the 
                sofa.)
                    Hey there, mr sleepy head, you want 
            some eggs and salmon?

                            ANNA
                (Smiling.)
                    I'm sure you could do with some 
            sustenance after last night's 
            frivolity.

                (Trying to pass her plate 
                over to Sean.)
                    Try them. Your housemate here is a 
            bit of a culinary genius. They're 
            not quite michelin star, but not 
            far off.

                            DOUGIE
                (Laughing, and talking to 
                Anna.)
                    Bullshit they're worthy of two. 
            Perhaps not three stars, but El 
            Bulli had to begin somewhere.

                (Looking at the ill 
                looking Sean now.)
                    No seriously man. You should have 
            some. I always think eggs make me 
            feel better after a night of 
            fucking some sorority girls.

                            SEAN
                (Looking shocked at 
                hearing this news.)
                    Shit. What? What the fuck?

                            ANNA
                    Yeah. My girl Cara wanted me to 
            give you this. Think she had a good 
            time last night.

                (Hands Sean a napkin with 
                a lipstick mark on it, 
                along with a number and 
                the name 'Cara'.)
                            SEAN
                (Looking at the napkin 
                and freaking out.)
                    Shit. Oh my fucking God. What did I 
            do?

                            DOUGIE
                    Don't sweat it man, like she was 
            HOT. H-O-to-the-T hot you know?

                            SEAN
                    Shit. Does Vicky know?

                            DOUGIE
                (Laughing, and looking at 
                his accomplice, Anna.)
                    Shit. I can't go along with this 
            any longer; I can't bear the 
            suffering. You were a fucking 
            ass-dick last night, but you 
            weren't a fucking ass-dick I'm 
            afraid. The pants stayed firmly 
            glued to your ballsack. Me and my 
            accomplice here just wanted to 
            freak the shit out of you. Mission 
            completed.

                (Dougie now turns and 
                high fives Anna.)
                            SEAN
                (Smiling now. Fucking 
                relieved.)
                    Fuck! Fuck, that was a good one. 
            Shit. I mean, I've never fucked a 
            sorority girl, so I don't know I 
            how I thought seven vodkas to the 
            wind would help. But, I have to 
            say, well played sirs.

                (Turning now to look at 
                Anna.)
                    Sorry, shit, I don't even remember 
            your name?

                            ANNA
                (Taking Sean's 
                outstretched hand, and 
                shaking it.)
                    Anna. UCLA student. Liar 
            extraordinaire. Nice to make your 
            acquaintance fellow knight.

                            SEAN
                (Now looking at Dougie 
                now.)
                    Shit. Like what the fuck happened? 
            I have brief memories of a lot of 
            fingers of vodka, then just 
            pleasant blackness.

    Nils and Tone now enter the house. Clearly having been 
    outside jogging, as both are wearing jogging clothes, and 
    are sweating. Especially the mildy overweight Tone.

                            TONE
                    Ah. Glad to see that Captain 
            Cumstain is now past the morning 
            wood stage. You look like Sigourney 
            Weaver in Aliens 3. Remember much 
            from last night friend?

                            DOUGIE
                    We just walked the sailor along the 
            plank, and was about to debrief him 
            when you two sweaty fucks strolled 
            in.

                            NILS
                (Looking at Sean.)
                    Shit. You were badass last night 
            Seany. Remember fucking that 
            sorority chick?

                            DOUGIE
                    I'm afraid that story has already 
            broke. Anna's potty mouth was 
            sufficient to convince the dear 
            boy.

                            TONE
                    Faaacck. I would have loved to have 
            seen that. Oh well. Maybe next time 
            you are the last person in our 
            friendship group to secure a job; 
            you go on a drunken fuck rage, and 
            wake hungover from shit, we can do 
            it again.

                            DOUGIE
                    Shit. Tone. Just because you look 
            like an out of shape Jabba the Hut, 
            dressed up as a drug dealer, go 
            easy on the boy.

                            TONE
                    You lazy fuck. We've just been 
            jogging. A word you mightn't be 
            acquainted with.

                            SEAN
                    Shit, sorry about that last night 
            man. I remember now. Good fucking 
            work on getting the job. Sorry I 
            reacted like Christian Bale on the 
            set of some shit sci fi movie.

                            DOUGIE
                (High fiving Sean, and 
                laughing.)
                    No worries my man. Just chill out. 
            If me and these crack addicts can 
            get a job, there's hope for you 
            yet!

                            SEAN
                (Laughing.)
                    Yeah. Good point! Now about time I 
            found some clothes. Shit. I bet Vix 
            has texted me like a thousand 
            times, so I should probably try and 
            find my phone.

    Tone rolls his eyes and looks at the other two. It is clear 
    that Vicky isn't necessarily the most popular person in the 
    house.

                            NILS
                    Ah don't worry about that man. We 
            saw her when we were out running. 
            Told her you'd just been up all 
            night studying for the interview on 
            Friday. She bought it.

                            SEAN
                    Awesome. Cheers boys. Much 
            appreciated. I owe you.

                            TONE
                    Yeah you do gay. Tomorrow night at 
            Rick's you get us all, like two 
            beers.

                            SEAN
                    Done. Mercenaries make the best 
            soldiers.

                (Now purposely Sean 
                starts collecting his 
                clothes, and putting them 
                on quickly as if he is 
                going somewhere.)
                            TONE
                    Where you off to in such a hurry? 
            You know Vicky is good right?

                            SEAN
                    Gentlemen, and

                (Looking at Anna.)
                    Fair maiden, I am afraid to say 
            that I have some work to do.

    Sean walks out of the room, leaving the others.

                            TONE
                    What a English Cigarette? Where's 
            he off to?

                            NILS
                    Prepare for his interview you 
            schoolboy fucker. You are such a 
            fucking crass moron sometimes you 
            know?

                            ANNA
                    Yeah, I suppose you are above that 
            sort of immature stuff Nils right?

                            NILS
                (A little bit unsure as 
                to what is going on as he 
                doesn't even know this 
                girl really.)
                    Err. Yeah. I mean mostly.

                            ANNA
                    Cool. Yeah I suppose whacking off 
            to a couple of cartoon Lions is 
            pretty adult.

    The other two guys just crack up laughing at this point, 
    with Anna smiling.

                            NILS
                (Looking straight at 
                Dougie.)
                    You fucker! You promised me you 
            wouldn't tell anyone.

                            DOUGIE
                (Laughing.)
                    I didn't. I told Anna. She's now 
            one of us I'm pleased to say.

    Nils walks out of the room in a huff, leaving the others 
    just cracking up.

                            DOUGIE
                (Moving over to Anna, and 
                hugging and kissing her.)
                    Well played there. Are there any 
            limits to your talents?

                            ANNA
                    Well, that's strike two. Want to go 
            up to the room to see if we can 
            make it a Turkey?

    Anna and Dougie then holding hands run outside the room 
    holding each other's hands.

                            TONE
                (Looking disgusted.)
                    Arrhh. For fuck's sake you guys.

                (He now sees that Anna 
                has left some of the Eggs 
                and Salmon on her plate, 
                and picks it up and 
                tastes it.)
                    Not bad. Not bad at all.

                (Now takes the food from 
                both plates and sits down 
                and begins to eat it.)
    MONTAGE OF SEAN WORKING ON HIS APPLICATIONS

    Scene of Sean reading, writing, surfing the website of the 
    company he has the interview with. He starts nodding off to 
    sleep at some point, then catches himself, goes and has a 
    shower, comes back into camera dressed in a suit, perhaps 
    the day after, and practising his personal statement stuff 
    into the mirror. The scene then moves to Sean sitting in a 
    room with a load of other candidates, writing some sort of 
    test. The scene ends with a roll call of all the first stage 
    successful candidates having their names read out in a room 
    by a stern looking HR lady. Sean is sitting there with his 
    fingers crossed, obviously very nervous. He is ecstatic when 
    his name actually gets read out. The montage scene ends with 
    the voice of Sean's interviewer asking Sean a question.

    INTERVIEW SCENE WITH COMPANY

    This is the final interview with a partner from the company 
    to which Sean is applying. He gets asked some interpersonal 
    question that he has practised. Perhaps referencing the 
    'what is your most significant moment?' The partner then 
    looks down, quietly reading Sean's CV, and Sean thinks the 
    worst. The interviewer then offers Sean a job then and 
    there. Sean holds it together, and shakes his hand. He 
    leaves the company then just jumps up and fist pumps a 
    policeman. Then apologises.

                            INTERVIEWER
                (Looking down at the 
                notes in front of him.)
                    So. You seem to have done pretty 
            well in the written and verbal 
            reasoning tests you took earlier.

                            SEAN
                    Oh, right, great.

                            INTERVIEWER
                    So...you're obviously intelligent?

                            SEAN
                    Errm. Yes I mean, I don't know.

                            INTERVIEWER
                (Looking up now at Sean.)
                    But...everyone left now is 
            intelligent. So, let's forget about 
            these tests, and your past 
            interviews. All that matters is 
            now.

                            SEAN
                    Ok. I mean, of course.

                            INTERVIEWER
                    So. What I need for you to do is to 
            convince me.

    Long pause.

                            SEAN
                    Errm. Ok. Sorry, what specifically 
            is it you want me to convince you 
            of?

                            INTERVIEWER
                    Why should I choose you above any 
            of those people out there in the 
            waiting room?

                            SEAN
                    Ok. So, I did this young enterprise 
            thing last year...

                            INTERVIEWER
                (Interrupting Sean.)
                    Everyone left here has done that.

                            SEAN
                    Ok. So, I am really hard working, I 
            don't quit at something until the 
            job is done...

                            INTERVIEWER
                (Interrupting Sean 
                again.)
                    They are all the hardest of 
            workers. Sean you need to convince 
            me you're a Bainie. That you belong 
            here. Above all your peers. 

                            SEAN
                (Thinking now, a bit of a 
                pause. Then he remembers 
                something he read last 
                night in his 
                preparation.)
                    Bain works only with the top 
            companies in the world. So 
            naturally you want the best 
            employees. I can't convey enough to 
            you about how much getting the 
            opportunity to take on this job 
            means, sorry, would mean to me. I 
            stayed up all night prepping for 
            today so that I could convince you 
            that I was the man for the job. I 
            mean, I practically haven't eaten 
            in the last 36 hours. I could 
            literally eat my arm off if that 
            would demonstrate my will to get 
            this job; killing two birds with 
            one stone. I mean...

                            INTERVIEWER
                (Interrupting Sean.)
                    Ok. I think I've heard enough. It 
            was very nice to meet you Sean. If 
            you could go and wait with the 
            others outside that'd be great. 
            We'll have a little meeting in 
            here, then will send for you again 
            in a few minutes.

                            SEAN
                (Obviously disappointed. 
                Thinks that he has 
                flunked it.)
                    Great. It was nice to meet you too.

    Sean leaves the room and goes and sits in the waiting room. 
    Various people are called back, the majority coming out 
    crying, or extremely annoyed. The odd person coming out 
    elated. At the end Sean is the only one left.

                            RECEPTIONIST
                (Receiving a call.)
                    Ok. Yes sir. I'll send him in.

                (Putting down the phone.)
                    Sean, they will see you now.

    Sean walks towards the door. Takes a deep breath and goes 
    in. There are three people sitting at the interview table. 
    Nothing is given away from their faces.

                            INTERVIEWER
                    Sean, if you could just take a 
            seat.

    Sean sits down slowly. Fearing the worst.

                            INTERVIEWER
                (After a long pause 
                looking through his 
                notes, then looking up at 
                Sean.)
                    Sean. You are without doubt the 
            biggest risk amongst the people we 
            are taking on this year. But, I 
            like to take risks. 

                            SEAN
                    That's ok. I understand.

                            INTERVIEWER
                    Sean, you do realise I just offered 
            you the job, right?

                            SEAN
                    What? Ok. Wow. I mean, are you 
            sure?

                            INTERVIEWER
                (Laughing.)
                    I was! I am sure Sean. There's no 
            one in there that wanted, I mean 
            really wanted to be a Bainie as 
            much as you. You reminded me of 
            myself a few years, and a few more 
            hairs ago. Just don't let me down. 
            I know you won't.

                            SEAN
                (Shaking everyone's hand 
                on the interview panel 
                over-enthusiastically.)
                    I won't sir. I won't. I mean...

                            INTERVIEWER
                    Sean? You can go now. Before they 
            change their minds!

                            SEAN
                    Yes. Sir. Right away. Thank you 
            again.

    Sean leaves the room, and fist pumps the air as soon as he's 
    in the waiting room. Now some sort of buoyant music comes 
    on.

                    

                     

    SEAN AND VICKY LOOKING ROUND APARTMENTS

                            REAL ESTATE AGENT
                    So, here is the dining room.

                (Opening the sliding door 
                out to the balcony 
                outside with a great 
                view.)
                    And here is the best but. A balcony 
            overlooking the Hollywood Hills. I 
            can tell you straight there aren't 
            any other apartments in your price 
            range that have one of these!

                            VICKY
                (Turning to Sean.)
                    Seany it's like absolutely perfect. 
            This is just the sort of place I 
            always dreamed us having together.

                            SEAN
                    I mean I like it too, but it's 
            really above what we said was our 
            upper limit, you know? I mean, do 
            we really need a second bedroom? 
            There are only two of us. Unless 
            you really want to alternate 
            between the rooms from one night to 
            the next, I don't really see the 
            point.

                            VICKY
                    But, what happens if my parents 
            want to stay?

                            REAL ESTATE AGENT
                    Yeah, I think this place is perfect 
            if you have parents to stay.

                            SEAN
                (Perturbed by the real 
                estate agent butting in.)
                    I mean...it's not like they're hard 
            up for cash Vix. Couldn't they just 
            stay in a hotel?

                            VICKY
                    No, they cannot Sean. They're not 
            animals Sean!

                            REAL ESTATE AGENT
                    Yeah, they're not.

                            SEAN
                (Glaring at the real 
                estate agent now.)
                    What sort of animals stay in 
            hotels? That sounds like something 
            you'd see on Keeping up with the 
            Kardashians.

                            VICKY
                    What happens if your Dad, or 
            [pauses] your friends want to stay?

                            SEAN
                    My Dad can always go home. He only 
            lives in Santa Monica!

                            REAL ESTATE AGENT
                    If he's anything like my Dad, he 
            probably would like a drink when he 
            visits his son, no?

                            VICKY
                    Yeah. It wouldn't be unlike your 
            Dad to imbibe a little.

                            SEAN
                (Glaring at the real 
                estate agent.)
                    He can always just get a cab!

                            VICKY
                    And your friends?

                            REAL ESTATE AGENT
                    Yeah, you can't just expect them to 
            sleep on the floor can you?

                            SEAN
                (Losing his cool now.)
                    Firstly....

                (Looking at the name tag 
                of the real estate 
                agent.)
                    ...Kylie. Why the hell do you seem 
            to give a shit where my 
            parents/friends sleep? Oh yeah. 
            It's because you get a 10% 
            commission on this place. Secondly, 
            Vix, like this place is obviously 
            too expensive for us. Like, I would 
            love to live here, but fuck, it's 
            like going to be more than three 
            quarters our combined salary.

                            VICKY
                (Taking Sean aside, 
                putting on a baby voice.)
                    Seany. 

                (Taking Sean's hands 
                now.)
                    Seany. I love you very very much. 
            And I love, I mean, love this 
            place.

                            SEAN
                    Don't give me the puppy eyes. I 
            can't deal with the puppy eyes.

                            VICKY
                    Just imagine, we can have great 
            dinners, just the two of us, out on 
            the balcony. And, [whispering into 
            his ear], I know you have always 
            wanted to do that thing.

                            SEAN
                    Thing?

                            VICKY
                    You know. THAT thing.

                            SEAN
                    Ahh. The thing? Ok.

                            VICKY
                    Well, I think this could be the 
            place. I mean. I know I've been 
            putting you off, but this could, 
            just could be the place for it.

                            SEAN
                    Really?

                            VICKY
                    Yeah. I mean, I know it's 
            expensive, but, you know, we only 
            start on these salaries. Within 
            like, a year, we will both be on 
            like 10 grand more, and it'll be 
            easy for us to afford this place.

                            SEAN
                    Yeah, I suppose. And I suppose 
            we'll be working so much that, it's 
            probably worth having a nice place 
            to go back to.

                            VICKY
                    Yeah. And just think of it, it'll 
            be just ours. Just the two of us.

                            SEAN
                    Ok. Ok. You've won me over fair 
            maiden.

                (Turning towards Kylie.)
                    Kylie, let me show you the money!

                            REAL ESTATE AGENT
                    Huh?

                            SEAN
                    Ok. You've just made a sale. Be 
            happy.

    SEAN AND VICKY MOVING IN

                            SEAN
                    [Opening the door] Hello? Vix?

                            TONE
                    [Walking behind him] Hey, we've got 
            a fagg-o-gram here for someone 
            called Vicky?

                    It's come in he form of a pasty, 
            chubby Jewish guy called Sean.

                            SEAN
                    Shut up you fat fuck.

                            VICKY'S DAD
                (Walking into the 
                hallway.)
                    Sean?

                            SEAN
                    Ah, hello mr Zimmerman. Sorry, we 
            errr thought it was just Vix?

                            VICKY'S DAD
                    Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you. 
            [Looking at Tone with a degree of 
            distain] And your 'friend' whom I 
            am yet to meet?

                            TONE
                    Sorry Mr Z, I'm Antony. I lived 
            with Sean for the past two years. 
            We have met actually, like twice, 
            but no worries.

                            VICKY'S DAD
                    Oh right. Yes, of course. Yes, 
            Vicky is just out with her mother 
            getting what you might call 
            'feminine items' for the apartment.

                            TONE
                    How come girls go to buy that sort 
            of shit together, like I don't get 
            it? Whenever I need 'male' products 
            - I just head into the 7-11, give 
            the checkout guy a nod, and he 

                    sorts me out with anything I want. 
            He can just read it in my eyes you 
            know?

                            VICKY'S DAD
                    Errr yes, well I'm not sure I do...

                            TONE
                    [Interrupting] You know. The guys' 
            shameful products code. Nod to the 
            left, eyes up....[looking at 
            Vicky's Dad]...so that's condoms. 
            Errrrm. If you look straight 
            forward, and  downwards, pursing 
            your lips...c'mon Mr Z?

                            VICKY'S DAD
                    It's Zimmerman. A name my father 
            fought to keep against the Nazis in 
            the Second World War in Poland. And 
            secondly, I haven't the...

                            TONE
                    Happy mags. You would have got 
            there you wily old one.

                            VICKY'S DAD
                    Secondly, I haven't the slightest 
            what you are talking about. Why on 
            earth did you start talking about 
            this? When I said feminine, all I 
            meant was they were off buying 

                    cushions and throws for the couch!

    Silence across the room, with Vicky's Dad obviously 
    dissapproving of Sean's close relationship with Tone. The 
    silence is broken by Vicky's mother entering through the 
    door, followed by Vicky.

                            VICKY'S MUM
                    Well hello everyone! Hi Sean, 
            Antony. How are you both?

                            SEAN
                    Good thanks Mrs Zimmerman, how was 
            the shopping?

                            VICKY
                    Well. We just about bought the 
            whole of Macy's! We've got cushions 
            galore, lamps, Venetian blinds for 
            the bedroom...

                            TONE
                    [Interrupting] Yes of course an 
            apartment isn't an apartment until 
            you have wooden slats on the 
            window.

                (Vicky shoots Tone a 
                dirty look.)
                            SEAN
                    Vix, that's great. But, can we 
            afford this stuff? I mean, we were 
            pretty close to the breadline 
            anyway, and surely this is stuff we 
            could have bought later?

                            VICKY'S MUM
                    Well Sean, there's no need to worry 
            about any of that, it is Arnold and 
            my's treat. Isn't that right 
            Arnold?

                            VICKY'S DAD
                    Of course dear. Lucy bear you just 
            tell me how much it all cost, and 
            I'll wire you the amount tomorrow. 
            Consider it a housewarming gift!

                            
    When Vicky's Dad says 'Lucy bear', Tone turns to Sean and 
    mouths, 'Lucy bear - what the fuck?' Sean does his best to 
    ignore it.

                            VICKY
                    Oh daddy. That's so great of you, 
            and kind. Thank you sosososososo 
            [in a baby

                    voice] much! (She is kissing her 
            father as she says this, and the 
            Dad is obviously happy.)

                            SEAN
                    Yes, thank you very much Mr 
            Zimmerman. It really is too kind of 
            you!

                            VICKY'S DAD
                    Not at all Sean. Not at all. I'm 
            just glad that you are following in 
            my footsteps and becoming a Bainie! 
            Gooooooooo bears! [Sean is half 
            laughing, half cringing, and sort 

                    of joining in with her Dad when he 
            says this.] So when do you start 
            your induction? When  I started, 
            they took us all away to Aspen for 
            the week skiing. Best week of my 
            life. A lot of  hard work, but a 
            lot of drinking too!

                            SEAN
                    So, we are going away tomorrow for 
            2 days to a hotel up in Santa 
            Barbera I think. We were going to 
            have a week in Hawaii, but, since 
            the recession, and everything they 

                    scaled it back.

                            VICKY'S DAD
                    That sounds like logical Bainie 
            thinking to me! Well, enjoy it son, 
            as after that it's hard, hard, 
            hard, work. For the next 40 years.

                            SEAN
                    Yes sir. I'm sure I'll do my best!

                            VICKY'S DAD
                    I have no doubt son. No doubt at 
            all you'll fit right in there! 
            Audrey, we really should be going, 
            I don't want to have to drive 
            across the valley when it's dark. 
            Sean, good luck. Antony.... Lucy 
            bear, all our love for your start 
            at work. I know you'll knock em 
            dead!

                            VICKY
                    Thanks Daddy! You take care, and 
            look after Mum.

                            TONE
                    I'm off too, I'm afraid Vix. Good 
            luck with your job.

                            VICKY
                    [coldly] Yes, you too Antony.

                            SEAN
                    Bye everyone, bye, thanks! [Closing 
            the door]

                (Taking Vicky's hand.)
                    Wanna go to the bedroom? I imagine 
            that wall mirror is pretty hot, if 
            you know what I mean?

                            VICKY
                    Oh Seany, I'd love to. But I need 
            to iron my shirts for the week.

                            SEAN
                    C'mon Vix! We only move into our 
            first place together once, you 
            know? Got to christen the bed, 
            otherwise it's bad luck.

                            VICKY
                    You don't believe in bad luck!

                            SEAN
                    Yeah, fuck it. I just really wanna 
            bone you.

                            VICKY
                    Ok. Ok. But let's make it a quick 
            one, I don't want the hassle of 
            ironing these shirts in the 
            morning!

    Sean and Vicky leave and go to the bedroom.

    FIRST DAY - MORNING

    Sean walks off the bus, and find himself at the foot of a 
    skyscraper. He takes a deep breath, briefcase in hand and 
    steps into the lobby.

                            SEAN
                    Hi

                            RECEPTIONIST 2
                    Good morning sir. I assume you are 
            here with the others for your first 
            day. Can I take your name please?

                            SEAN
                    Yes, that's right. Mr Sean Colley 
            here. Reporting for duty. 

                (He laughs a little at 
                his joke after he has 
                said it.)
                            RECEPTIONIST 2
                    Ok. No problem. You can take a seat 
            over there with the others. And if 
            you could wear your name tag at all 
            times, just for today, don't worry, 
            that would be great. 

    Sean walks over to the others. Some of whom are sat, the 
    others of which are standing, chatting amongst themselves.

                            JOHN
                (Cockily.)
                    So, it was the obvious choice I 
            suppose. I majored in economics at 
            Brown, then moved over to LA for my 
            masters in international business.

                            DANIEL
                    For me. It was a toss up between 
            here, BCG, McKinsey - who all 
            offered me places. It came down 
            partly to the prestige, but mostly 
            the money to be honest. The 
            starting package here was head and 
            shoulders above the rest.

                            CLARE
                    I wouldn't say I was quite as 
            certain as that about the choice of 
            career.

                (Sean smiles when she 
                says this, thinking that 
                she might be someone she 
                can relate to more.)
                    But I kept weighing this against 
            working for congress. I had an 
            internship with Senator Collins 
            last summer, and he offered me a 
            job. 

                (Sean now looks less 
                easy-going about it all.)
                    And, I got an offer from Harvard 
            Law, to go to grad school there.

                (Sean now looks quite 
                intimidated.)
                    Ultimately, I figured, there was 
            nothing to lose in muddying my 
            hands in a bit of real business for 
            a few years, before trying to enter 
            politics proper. Surveys have shown 
            that a high proportion of the 
            electorate look favourably on those 
            who have spent time in industry. 

                            DANIEL
                    Hi there. You must be Sean?

                            SEAN
                    Hi, yes that's right.

                (Pointing at his name 
                badge, laughing 
                uneasily.)
                    Says it right here. So must be 
            something in it.

                            JOHN
                    Whereabouts were you at school? Ivy 
            League or West Coast?

                            SEAN
                    UCLA. Yep. Just got done with that 
            shiiit. Like two weeks ago we 
            packed up and moved over downtown.

                            JOHN
                    You must be the only one here not 
            to have gone to one of the top 
            schools in the country. Bribe them 
            in the interview? 

                            CLARE
                (Laughing.)
                    Oh John. Go easy on the man. I've 
            heard that UCLA actually has some 
            of the best business lecturers on 
            the West Coast. I mean, I think 
            Nouriel Rubini did a guest lecture 
            series there this past year. Am I 
            right Sean?

                            SEAN
                (Cluelessly.)
                    Yes. That's right.

                            JOHN
                    Ah. Rubini. The fortune-teller of 
            doom. Interesting chap. Never could 
            quite get on board with his 
            arguments for the financial crisis 
            though. Sean, having seen the devil 
            in the flesh, what do you think to 
            his ideas?

                            SEAN
                (Bullshitting.)
                    Well...There's no denying the man 
            is a genius, but some of his 
            policies are perhaps a little too 
            extreme for me.

                            JOHN
                    Ah. A New Keynesian are we?

                            SEAN
                    Yep. That's right.

                            JOHN
                    So, do you think all this 
            quantitative easing is helping 
            bring employment up to NAIRU?

                            SEAN
                    I mean, I suppose you could put it 
            like that. Although, I have to 
            confess economics wasn't my major.

                            DANIEL
                    A businessman if ever I saw one?

                            SEAN
                    Well. Not exactly. I mean, I took a 
            few classes in my sophomore year on 
            business and economics. But I 
            actually majored in philosophy.

                            DANIEL
                    Ah. Right ok.

                            JOHN
                (Particularly smugly.)
                    Isn't that a way of just saying you 
            spent four years debating the 
            existence of God, drinking and 
            arguing over the consciouness with 
            your buddies?

                            SEAN
                    Well. Not exactly. Philosophy is 
            the field of the pursuit of true 
            knowledge through extremely 
            thorough and logical deduction. 
            Unlike the common misconception of 
            us as all - stoners - the questions 
            which we try to answer are more 
            academic than those typically 
            encountered drinking beers with 
            your buddies. 

                            JOHN
                (Laughing in his 
                ignorance.)
                    Right. Sure Sean. It's not an 
            interrogation after all. I mean 
            we're all here, on a level pegging 
            for now, as we all made it through 
            the same interviews, the same 
            exams.

    A bit of an awkward silence falls across the group, but this 
    is ended abruptly with the announcement from a more senior 
    Bainie from the front of the entrance hall. 

                            DAVID SINCLAIR
                    

                    Good morning everybody. I want to 
            start by welcoming you all to our 
            family. For some of you this is the 
            result of a lifetime's work and 
            desire to be a part of this. For 
            others, you will use this as a 
            stepping stone onto great things no 
            doubt.

    Gerard stumbles through the door, looking slightly 
    dishevelled, carrying his suitcase as well as its handle 
    (which appears to have broken). 

                            DAVID SINCLAIR
                    You will meet some amazing people 
            in your time here. You will learn 
            some valuable skills, and lessons, 
            such as how to be punctual for 
            important meetings. 

                    

                    (He says this looking at Gerard, 
            the group minus Sean sniggers.)

                            DAVID SINCLAIR
                    These next few days will be very 
            memorable for you, and will stay 
            with you long after, should you 
            choose to move on from Bain. They 
            will be a lot of hard work, and 
            will be a good opportunity for you 
            to meet members of the Bain family, 
            both young and old. However, it 
            should be said, that we even though 
            we work hard, we do not crimp on 
            the playing, and there will be 
            plenty of time for that. Before we 
            get to the playing however, there 
            is the slight logistical issue of 
            getting us all up to Santa Barbera. 
            If you can all please follow me and 
            Yolanda outside, we will lead you 
            towards the luxury coaches which we 
            have hired for the journey. If you 
            can also pick up your week's 
            introductory packs on the table, 
            containing a calendar of events, 
            group allocations, as well as some 
            required reading for the journey, 
            that would be great.

                            GERARD
                (Speaking to Sean's group 
                of people.)
                    Hey, what did I miss?

                            JOHN
                    Only the opportunity to make a good 
            first impression.

                            CLARE
                    David was just introducing us to 
            the family. Where were you?

                            GERARD
                    My mum forgot to wake me up at 7am. 
            I then broke my suitcase on the way 
            to the bus. What a morning!

                            JOHN
                (Laughing smugly.)
                    Well, I hope you have your mum in 
            that suitcase cause I think there 
            are going to be some early starts 
            for you this week.

    All the rest of the group minus Sean and Gerard start to 
    walk towards the table to collect their week packs, and to 
    file out the door.

                            SEAN
                (To only Gerard.)
                    Don't worry man. You didn't miss 
            anything. Just a tiny bit of the 
            smugness on ice show.

                            GERARD
                    Ah good. Sorry, what was that about 
            a show?

                            SEAN
                    Don't worry. Just an icebreaker. 
            Wanna sit with me on the bus?

                            GERARD
                    Yeah. Sounds good.

    Sean and Gerard, following everyone else, walk and collect 
    their packs, then walk out through the doors towards the 
    buses.

    HOTEL SCENE - LATER

    Sean is in his room spread eagled on his bed still wearing 
    his suit, obviously wondering what he is doing there. 

    There is a knock at the door, and Sean goes to open it.

                            SEAN
                    Hello?

                            DANIEL
                    Hi Sean, we've got our first 
            session down in the conference room 
            in 5 minutes. Want to come with us 
            now?

                            SEAN
                    Err. Ok. I'll see you down there, I 
            just need to unpack my stuff.

                            DANIEL
                    Ok. Great. Can you also remind that 
            guy you were sat next to on the 
            bus?

                            SEAN
                    You mean Gerard?

                            DANIEL
                    Yep, that's it. Just don't want to 
            piss the people running the session 
            off if one of us is late.

                            SEAN
                    Ok. No problem. Will do.

    Sean closes the door. Leans up against it. Takes a deep 
    breath and waits for Daniel to disappear. Then he opens the 
    door and goes and knocks on Gerard's room across the hall.

                            SEAN
                    Hey, Gerard? Hellloooo. You in 
            there?

    Gerard answers the door just wearing an open hotel dressing 
    gown and his briefs.

                            SEAN
                    Hello My Heffner, I was wondering 
            if I could tempt you away from the 
            playboy bunnies for a few minutes?

                            GERARD
                    Haha. Oh yeah. We have that 
            training thing in like half an hour 
            right?

                            SEAN
                    Err. Actually it's like in two 
            minutes. Wanna get one of those 
            girls to dress you and meet me down 
            in the lobby in 5?

                            GERARD
                    Yep. I won't be long. Just need to 
            put my day braces in.

                            SEAN
                    Sure.

    The door closes, and cuts to a scene down in the lobby with 
    Sean waiting. Looking at his watch. Gerard then appears as 
    the elevator doors open.

                            GERARD
                    Hey, sorry man. I couldn't work out 
            how to redo my tie. My mum did it 
            for me this morning, but I managed 
            to mess it up when I took it off 
            for the bath. I'm use to the 
            elastic kind I must admit.

                            SEAN
                (Taking Gerard's tie and 
                adjusting his tie.)
                    No worries. There we go. Shall we 
            venture into the fold?

    The two of them then walk into the conference room, where 
    there are tables with other new starters around them. David 
    Sinclair is talking at the front of the room and stops when 
    they enter.

                            DAVID SINCLAIR
                    And it's fair to assume that you 
            don't know the market 
            capitalisation of their 
            competitors...

                (Seeing now Sean and 
                Gerard enter.)
                    Ah. Good afternoon gentlemen. Even 
            though you are late for this 
            session, I am sure a team will take 
            pity on you both.

                (Looking around at the 
                other teams seated on 
                tables.)
                    Any takers?

                (Seeing that no one takes 
                them. Then looking at 
                John on one of the 
                frontmost tables.)
                    Ok. John. Would you mind taking 
            this driftwood off my hands?

                            JOHN
                    Yes. Of course. 'A' ok capitan.

    Sean and Gerard sit down on the table to a muted welcoming 
    from the table. Sean tries to nod at a few faces but gets no 
    response.

                            DAVID SINCLAIR
                    As I was saying. You can assume 
            nothing about the competitive 
            market, ergo you will need to state 
            any assumptions you make and take 
            this uncertainty into account for 
            your strategy and any calculations 
            you need to make. Now does anyone 
            have any questions?

                            JOHN
                    Could I just clarify a point? The 
            presentation we are making should 
            have optics for a client or 
            internal audience?

                            DAVID SINCLAIR
                    Good point John. I was hoping that 
            someone would ask that.

                (When David says this, 
                John smugly smiles and 
                looks around the table 
                for approval.)
                    Yes. It is always important to 
            understand to whom you will be 
            delivering a presentation as this 
            will guide your approach, and 
            ultimately determine the style of 
            presentation. I think it is most 
            interesting to assume that the 
            audience will be a mixture of 
            client and internal members.

                (Now looking about the 
                room.)
                    Ok. If there are no more questions, 
            then please start. We will regroup 
            again for presentations at 3.45. 
            That gives you all one and a half 
            hours.

    David Sinclair then walks away from the place where he is 
    giving the presentation, goes to speak with some advisors, 
    and ceases to be in view.

                            JOHN
                (Addressing the table at 
                which he is sitting 
                lecturially.)
                    Well. Having done an internship 
            here last summer I am happy to take 
            the lead on this one.

                (He looks around, and 
                silence greets him. He 
                mistakes the lack of 
                agreement as a 
                confirmation of his 
                self-imposed role.)
                            SEAN
                    Errm. Ok. I'm not disagreeing with 
            you, but is there actually the need 
            for a leader within this 
            assignment? I mean, I figured this 
            was supposed to be a sort of 
            teamwork thing?

                            JOHN
                (Taking offense.)
                    Sean. I do respect your view, but 
            having worked at Bain before I can 
            tell you that it is essential for 
            every project to have a leader.

                            SEAN
                    Ok. I'm not going to argue with you 
            on this. I just wondered whether 
            this project was of sufficiently 
            short length that there wouldn't be 
            an explicit need for a leader. But, 
            for the sake of time, let's just go 
            with your idea.

                            JOHN
                    Ok. Thank you Sean for the wasted 2 
            minutes. Ok. I think given that we 
            are attempting to value a company 
            who is a leader in its marketplace, 
            I think that the Bain '4 force' 
            framework works best.

                (Looking around the 
                table, John thinks he is 
                being exceedingly smart 
                by using lingo that most 
                of the people won't 
                understand.)
                    Ok. Great. So, we need to think 
            about: threat of new entrants - 
            Clare and Tom, can you guys cover   
            this? Bargaining power of suppliers 
            - Mark and Dan, please. Threat of 
            substitute products; Oliver - I 
            know as a former Bainie you will be 
            ok 'going solo' haha. And finally 
            the bargaining power of buyers; 
            Sean and Gerard, if you will. Good.

                            GERARD
                (Speaking unconfidently.)
                    Sorry, I just wanted to say, 
            shouldn't we be looking at 
            competitors here? I mean, without 
            this information how can we know 
            whether the company as a whole 
            makes up a small or large 
            proportion...

                            JOHN
                (Interrupting.)
                    There's no need to think about 
            competitors here. It's the 'main 
            player' in its market. Ok. Right, 
            is everyone ready here?

                            SEAN
                    John, shouldn't we debate the point 
            which Gerard raised at least? I'm 
            not a business major, but it seems 
            like the argument could have some 
            merit.

                            JOHN
                    Sean, I don't want us all to waste 
            another 5 minutes debating 
            something which is obviously not of 
            importance. David said earlier that 
            we didn't need to worry about 
            competitors. Right troops, into the 
            breach dear Friends I say?

                            SEAN
                    Sorry, didn't he just say we need 
            to make assumptions about 
            competitor size? That's not the 
            same as saying 'don't worry about 
            competitors'?

                            JOHN
                    I'm afraid a decision has been made 
            Sean. Ok I will come round your 
            groups individually and offer some 
            tips on direction, execution as 
            well as optics. Begin.

    The individual pairs split off, and start to brainstorm 
    ideas about on what the time should be spent. Now fade to 
    music, and then to the presentation scene. John is centre 
    stage, presenting from a power point off a computer. He 
    presents the last slide upon which the team has come up with 
    a range of values for the company value. 

                            JOHN
                    And hence we reached a consensus as 
            to the price which a competitor or 
            private equity firm should base its 
            offer. Anywhere from $10.5m - $14m 
            would be sensible.

    The panel who are sitting in front composed of David 
    Sinclair, and a couple of others, look quite impassive about 
    the whole thing.

                            PANEL MEMBER 1
                    Thank you John, that was 
            interesting.

                            PANEL MEMBER 2
                    Yes. The only point I would make 
            was that you could have focussed on 
            competitors a little more.

                            DAVID SINCLAIR
                    I agree. John I was a bit surprised 
            by the lack of attention to this 
            area here. What was the reason for 
            leaving this aspect of the market 
            out?

                            JOHN
                (Still appearing 
                confident, but starting 
                to talk a bit quicker; 
                being a little less 
                certain of himself than 
                he was.)
                    Yes. We did debate that point 
            actually, but came to a group 
            decision that since the company 
            were a market leader, the 
            competitive threat wouldn't be so 
            prominent. 

                (He looks for approval 
                now from David in 
                particular, not getting 
                it.)
                    But, on reflection, it's evident to 
            me that I should have pushed the 
            competitive argument more in the 
            debate.

                            DAVID SINCLAIR
                    Don't beat yourself up over it. The 
            rest of the presentation was good. 
            Just the sort of material I'd 
            expect from a future manager.

                (John is smiling when he 
                says this.)
    David now stands up and addresses the entire crowd of 
    newbies. 

                            DAVID SINCLAIR
                    Right. Well done. Good work by the 
            majority of you. I think there's a 
            consensus that we're all looking 
            forward to having you in the 
            office. Which is good since you'll 
            be there from Wednesday for at 
            least a couple of years. As a token 
            of our appreciation, and in 
            anticipation of things to come, we 
            have paid for all your drinks 
            tonight. Go have a great time, meet 
            your new colleagues,  and we'll see 
            you back in here tomorrow morning 
            at 9am.

    BAR SCENE - EVENING

    The new recruits are all sitting round a table in the hotel 
    bar, dressed up quite nicely in chinos and shirts. Sean 
    brings back some beers from the bar, and sets them down on 
    the table; giving one to Gerard. The table is littered with 
    a range of canopes, and posh snacks.

                            GERARD
                    Thanks man. Appreciate it.

                            SEAN
                    My generosity knows no bounds.

    John comes back from the bar and sets a bottle of Crystal on 
    the table; looking rather smug at himself.

                            JOHN
                    I think we can go a little more 
            upmarket here. 

    Everyone other than Sean looks impressed at this stunt.

                            CLARE
                    Whoa. Is that Crystal I smell?

                            JOHN
                    Only the best for the best.

                            CLARE
                    Hmm. Excellent. 

                (Taking a drink.)
                    So...how did everyone find their 
            first day? Reminds me of starting 
            Kindergarten.

                            SIMON
                    I thought it was ok. Not quite the 
            intellectual challenge I was hoping 
            for, but passable.

                            JOHN
                    Yes. It was mildly quaffable. A 
            Merlot of days. Enough to give you 
            a taste for the stuff, but not 
            overly refined. Don't worry, when 
            we get into the field proper, 
            there'll be sufficient intellectual 
            challenges. Trust me.

                    

                            CLARE
                    Where did you learn about wine?

                (Sean winces at her 
                comment in disgust.)
                    I must admit - whilst I can just 
            about order a bottle from a menu - 
            I normally can't get past red and 
            white.

                            JOHN
                    Oh. It was with David funnily 
            enough. At the end of last summer, 
            we all went away on a wine tasting 
            weekend. David actually has one of 
            the largest collections of fine 
            wine in the city. He actually told 
            me I have quite a fine palate as it 
            happens, a good taste.

                            SEAN
                (Taking a drink of his 
                beer, mumbling slightly.)
                    For his cock?

    Gerard starts laughing uncontrollably at this point.

                            JOHN
                    Sorry Sean, I didn't quite catch 
            that?

                            SEAN
                    I just asked Gerard if he had tried 
            the Ham Hock. It really is 
            excellent.

                            GERARD
                (Downing his champagne, 
                and shooting it with his 
                beer.)
                    Right. I'm off to get sooooommme 
            beeerrrsss. Any one want any? 
            Arruugga!

                (Standing up as he says 
                the last thing, and 
                turning and walking off 
                in a direction not 
                towards the bar, the 
                doing a double take, and 
                spinning back towards the 
                bar.)
                            SEAN
                (Catching up with 
                Gerard.)
                    Whoa. You're on it tonight! Wanna 
            take it easy for a minute though, 
            we've got a long evening ahead of 
            us?

                            GERARD
                    Sorry man, did your test results 
            come back negative?

                            SEAN
                    What? What are you talking about?

                            GERARD
                (Obviously quite 
                drunkenly now.)
                    Well I just got mine back. The Dr 
            gave me the news on the phone. 
            Turns out I'm M-A-N positive. Like 
            a big case of it.

    At this he hands Sean a shot, and they both down it.

                            SEAN
                    Cool. Ok. Wanna go and grab some 
            air man? The room is a bit full too 
            full with dicks called John for my 
            liking.

                            GERARD
                    Yeah. He's definitely not 
            symptomatic of having the M-A-N 
            gene.

                (At saying this he stays 
                resolutely stuck to the 
                bar.)
                            SEAN
                    So, do you wanna come outside with 
            me?

                            GERARD
                    No. Queer. Actually, I'm just going 
            to have a couple of cleansers here. 
            A few social ones.

                            SEAN
                    Suit yourself.

    At this Sean walks outside and into the night air. He pulls 
    a cigarette out of his pocket, and starts smoking it. Taking 
    a deep inhale of breath; looking up at the stars. He takes 
    his phone out of his pocket, and reads a message from Vicky 
    saying, 'Hope your first day is going well - love you x'. At 
    this he sighs, puts his phone back in his pocket and takes 
    another drag of his cigarette. He then hears a bit of noise 
    round the side of the hotel, with people laughing. He walks 
    round the corner and sees a load of old people with a few 
    young children around playing boules, having a great time. 
    He smiles to himself. He is about to walk away, then he 
    hears a younger female voice amongst them. Then he catches 
    sight of Emma - a beautiful girl, dressed in jeans; smiling 
    and laughing along with the old and young alike. The 
    dialogue happens a bit far away from Sean, but he is able to 
    overhear the following.

                            EMMA
                (Reacting to a ball 
                thrown by one of the 
                older men, which misses 
                the target some margin.)
                    Not bad. George, did you forget 
            your glasses again?

                            GEORGE
                    I think I left them next to your 
            sense of bodily coordination.

                (He pauses, then they 
                both laugh.)
    Sean laughs to himself, and starts to stroll back towards 
    the entrance to the hotel.

    Upon entering the hotel, and walking into the bar, Sean sits 
    down again on the table, and has a sip of his beer.

                            SEAN
                    Hey, have any of you guys seen 
            Gerard?

                            CLARE
                    Errm. I could be wrong, but isn't 
            that him doing the earth worm over 
            there?

    They look over and see Gerard surrounded by a bunch of 
    laughing recruits and older hotel staff, lying on the floor, 
    shuffling; attempting to do some sort of dance move in an 
    uncoordinated fashion.

    Sean runs over, pulls Gerard up, at which point Gerard 
    starts acting like this is some sort of dance off. He starts 
    shimmying his pects in a Beyonce fashion, in the direction 
    of Sean. The music is 'shake it like a polaroid picture' by 
    Outkast. Sean grabs him again, and tries to get him out the 
    circle, and is shook off by Gerard again. 

                            JOHN
                (Laughing.)
                    Hey! Why don't we let the little 
            man do his thing?

    Sean sees that Gerard is about to vomit, grabs his arm 
    firmly, and escorts him strongly (although Gerard is 
    acquiescing now) out of the room.

    GETTING GERARD TO BED IN HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

    The elevator opens, and Sean and Gerard 'spill out' into the 
    hallway. 

                            GERARD
                    Are we flying now? I want to fly 
            home.

                            SEAN
                (Struggling under the 
                weight of Gerard's limp 
                body.)
                    Errm. I think we'll walk it this 
            time, we'll go to LAX tomorrow.

                            GERARD
                (Flopping to the ground, 
                and spreading himself out 
                as if on a bed on the 
                floor outside his room.)
                    Ok. I'm going first class now.

    Sean feels inside Gerard's pocket, goes to the door to open 
    it, walks back to Gerard, picks him up, and walks a bit 
    closer to the door, the door shutting before he can enter. 
    He then does the same again, but the door shuts too fast for 
    him to push both him and Gerard through again. He tries 
    again, but the door still thwarts him! He turns round, his 
    back against the door, sweating, and sinks to the floor.

                            EMMA
                (Staring at Sean from the 
                entrance to her room, 
                walking over to him.)
                    I know I shouldn't find this funny, 
            but that was hilarious. 

                            SEAN
                (Obviously quite 
                perturbed, as he was 
                unaware anyone was 
                watching his ordeal.)
                    Really? The humour has failed to 
            penetrate my butt cheeks 
            unfortunately.

                            EMMA
                    Yeah. Well I'm not sure even 'Curb 
            Your Enthusiam' would go that deep. 
            That was actually like the real 
            life equivalent of the Peter 
            Griffin Frog episode. Up. Slide. 
            Up. Slide. Well played.

                            SEAN
                    Thanks. Glad to hear it helped one 
            of us.

                            EMMA
                    Want a hand with that pescie door? 

                            SEAN
                    That'd be great. I'll accept it as 
            payment for the Family Guy 
            reenactment.

    Emma holds the door while Sean drags Gerard into the room 
    and slops him onto the bed. Sean disappears into the 
    bathroom, fills a glass of water, and returns.

                            SEAN
                (To Gerard, making him 
                take a sip of water.)
                    Ok man. Try not to throw this 
            immediately up in my face. I draw 
            the line at facial vomit.

                            GERARD
                (In between taking sips 
                of his drink.)
                    We're the biggest L-A-Ds here 
            right?

                            SEAN
                (Laughing, looking at 
                Emma.)
                    I think you certainly are. I reckon 
            I came in third out of three. Sleep 
            well Balboa.

    Sean and Emma walk out of the room, and Sean closes the door 
    behind him.

                            SEAN
                    Thanks for that - really think 
            sleeping al fresco was inevitable 
            without your help.

                            EMMA
                    That's ok. I consider door holding 
            one of my finest skills. That and 
            snide popular culture commentary.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing.)
                    Well nonetheless I was glad to be 
            in the presence of a master of the 
            field.

                            EMMA
                    I'm off to bed now. Got to get up 
            and look after too many little 
            people in about 7 hours now.

                            SEAN
                    Cool. Thanks again.

                            EMMA
                    See you around.

                            SEAN
                    Yep. See you around.

    SEAN WAKING GERARD UP - MORNING

    Sean has let himself into the room, and wafts a coffee in 
    front of Gerard's unconscious face. Gerard starts sniffing 
    at the coffee and following it with his nose.

                            GERARD
                    That smells good. Really good.

                            SEAN
                    Help yourself good fellow.

    Gerard sits up. Realising he is still in his shirt and 
    trousers from last night. When he sits up he immediately 
    notices the extent of his hangover; clutching his head.

                            GERARD
                    Aaaarrgghhh. My head is full of 
            little angry people.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing.)
                    Been there before. Got to give 
            those people their dues though. 
            They know how to move.

                            GERARD
                (Looking up at Sean now, 
                as he realises the 
                significance of what he 
                has just said.)
                    Did wormy come out last night?

                            SEAN
                    L-A-D positive he did! It was 
            fucking awesome.

                            GERARD
                    Really?

                            SEAN
                    No. I was merely trying to buoy 
            your fragile self confidence. But, 
            on the plus side, no one saw you 
            throw up on the cacti in reception.

                            GERARD
                    Jeees. When am I going to learn 
            that Asians can't take their 
            liquor? Or, at least, shouldn't mix 
            it with dancing.

                            SEAN
                    I wouldn't worry. I reckon I'll 
            supersede this episode by the end 
            of the weekend. I normally have 
            about a weekly cycle of idiocy. I'm 
            about due to peak again tonight.

                            GERARD
                    Thanks man. Appreciate the pep 
            talk.

                            SEAN
                    No worries mate. But, listen, get 
            yourself showered and smelling less 
            of bile, and meet me outside in the 
            corridor in 15 minutes. Don't want 
            give Sinclair any more reason not 
            to rescind our offers of 
            employment.

                            GERARD
                    Cool. Yep will do.

                            
     

    

                    

                    

                    

                    

                    

    END OF FILM
