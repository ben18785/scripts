    INTERVIEW MONTAGE SCENE - INTERVIEWING AND FUCKING ABOUT AT 
    HOME

    Split screen between Sean's efforts to interview, and his 
    life at his house with his mates. 

    POST INTERVIEW STONING - EVENING

    Sean enters wearing a suit, looking sharp, but a little 
    rough around the edges.

                            SEAN
                    Hey guys.

                            DOUGIE
                    Hey man, come and try out the new 
            Oboe.

                            SEAN
                    Where the fuck did you get an Oboe 
            from? Isn’t that Nils’?

                            DOUGIE
                    I won it off him in a bet. I bet 
            him he couldn’t whack off to finish 
            whilst we played The Lion King 
            Soundtrack outside his room. To his 
            credit he lost.

                            SEAN
                    Haha. Amazing. (Taking the Oboe) 
            You know wind instruments remind me 
            of this girl, Sarah, in middle 
            school? Seeing her blow down a 
            cylinder gave half the class hard 
            ons.

                            DOUGIE
                         (Lauging)

                    Awesome. My middle school days were 
            divided between pogs and trying to 
            avoid showing my pube forest 
            whenever we showered for gym class.

                            TONE
                    So you were a retard repeating 
            grades at age 13 too?

                            DOUGIE
                    You fucking dick. [He's actually 
            annoyed] I’ve told you a million 
            times I'm a bit older was 'cause I 
            caught mono off this hot chick in 
            my first year.

                            TONE
                    Sure. Sure. I forgot you had a 
            face-off-quality facial transplant 
            with a Lyndon B Johnson before you 
            met us.

                            DOUGIE
                    LBJ? Better than a fat, cross-eyed, 
            masturbatory resident of Moordor 
            you fuck.

                            SEAN
                (Picking up the Oboe)
                    Haha. Let me try it. 

                            TONE
                    You need to finger A minor to get 
            it to work.

                            DOUGIE
                    Shut up you fuck. 

                (He's high when he says 
                this)
                    Just ‘blow forest’…. ‘blow’

    Smoke starts to come out of the end of the Oboe, and all 
    three start laughing.

                            SEAN
                    That’s fucking awesome. ‘Amadeus’ 
            would have been much better if the 
            wood section used these.

                            DOUGIE
                (Laughing)
                    Yeah. Totally. 

                            TONE
                    Why the fuck you dressed like a 
            paedophilic civil servant?

                            SEAN
                    I’ve told your forgetful stoner 
            arse, like ten times, you dick. I’m 
            interviewing all week. Something 
            you seem to have avoided. Moordor 
            is operating in times of full 
            employment it seems. 

                            DOUGIE
                (In the voice of 
                Gollum/Elrond/Gandalf)
                    The 'all seeing eye' has guaranteed 
            him a job.

                            TONE
                    Least I've got a job for next year 
            you prick.

                            DOUGIE
                    Like your piss-ant job in 
            accountancy is anything to brag 
            about.

                            TONE
                    Well. Fuck-me-sideways sisters, as 
            I didn't tell you I'm going to be 
            James Liu's boss next year?

                            SEAN
                    What? How the fuck could you be 
            anyone's boss? You're just 
            starting.

                            TONE
                    Well, I'm starting in the high net 
            worth section. Well known 
            pan-accountancy to be the best 
            department in tax. Liuy is starting 
            in audit. Well known to be the 
            lowest of the low. Ergo, I will be 
            senior to him come September.

                            DOUGIE
                    Are you fucking kidding? You're not 
            even going to be in the same 
            department. You can't just claim to 
            be his boss, just because you think 
            your department is better.

                            TONE
                    Well everyone in E&Y thinks it's 
            true. 

                            DOUGIE
                    You fucking imbecile. Every time I 
            get my hopes up that you are less 
            of a dick than you used to be, you 
            just come in and surpass all 
            expectations. You had previously 
            only climbed the Mount Washington 
            of dicks, now you've taken on 
            Oxygen and moved onto the 
            Himalayas. 

                            TONE
                    I'm sorry I've managed to get my 
            life together. Sorry I've not spent 
            my last 10 years switching majors, 
            masturbating, and playing Tiger 
            Woods. Sorry, I haven't been 
            rejected by every single 
            shit-fucked-up company out there.

                            DOUGIE
                    Fuck off you pap smear.

                            TONE
                    You duck-fucker.

                            SEAN
                    Anyway, I didn’t get the OC&C gig. 
            Feedback from the interview was 
            that I didn’t have enough 
            experience.

                            TONE
                    Yeah, I never got that experience 
            shit. It’s like cancelling gym 
            class for Jewish kids, then 
            complaining that there aren’t any 
            Jews in baseball.

                            DOUGIE
                    There aren’t any Jews in baseball 
            anyway you dick.

                            SEAN
                    True. I just keep getting asked all 
            these bullshit questions. Like, 
            ‘Tell me a time where you succeeded 
            against all odds’.

                            TONE
                    You got laid once didn’t you?

                            SEAN
                    Yeah, one more time than you right? 
            Anyway, I ended up making up some 
            bullshit answer about how I 
            organised a college talent concert. 

                            TONE
                    You fucking hate talent 
            competitions!

                            SEAN
                    Yeah. Have no idea why I spun that 
            web. They just kept asking me what 
            was so hard about it. All I could 
            say, over and over again, was like, 
            ‘It was the wires…just so many 
            wires…haha…like more wires than you 
            can imagine...’ I sounded like a 
            failed cable engineer.

    Dougie and Tone start play acting. Tone lies down on the 
    table as if he’s Frankenstein’s monster. Dougie starts to 
    ‘operate’ on him using spoons, forks, etc.

                            DOUGIE
                    I’m nearly there…one more thing and 
            my work will be complete. I will 
            have created my exact likeness; 
            animated the inanimate; created 
            life! It’s (nearly) alive…

    He grabs a few wires from the playstation and ‘inserts’ them 
    under Tone. Sean is laughing whilst they do all of this.

                            DOUGIE
                    The only thing is, Where the hell 
            did these wires come from? Shit. 
            Where the hell does this go? So 
            many fucking wires! Is it from his 
            brain? Did I forget to connect his 
            arms? Oh, I see. His cock is 
            unbiologically small. I must have 
            forgotten to connect it when I did 
            his balls.

                            TONE
                    I think you must be confusing my 
            leg again. You are so used to your 
            tiny pecker that you think it’s a 
            fucking mamba when you see it.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing)
                    Your bent cock is more like a 
            seahorse than a snake to be honest.

    Tone and Dougie sit up again.

                            DOUGIE
                    Well fuck it. You’ll get something 
            man. If this spindle-dicked fuck 
            can bag a job, so can we. In the 
            meantime, pass the Oboe so I can 
            practice my scales.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing)
                    Yeah…I definitely could do with 
            improving my B flat major scale.

    Montage scene of them all getting high, and doing fucking 
    random shit. Try and have a scene of them doing salom-esq 
    trials down the stairs on a pair of roller skates.

    

    HUNGOVER WITH VICKY - MORNING

    Sean is lying asleep face down on his bed wearing only a 
    pair of roller skates and a tutu.

                            VICKY
                    Sean.

                            SEAN
                (Moans)
                    Aaaaarrgghh.

                            VICKY
                (Leaning closer to Sean, 
                so that her face is next 
                to his)
                    Sean!

                            SEAN
                (Moaning louder and still 
                obviously out of it; 
                dreaming)
                    What does the heron king want?

                    

                            VICKY
                    What? Sean, get up for fuck's sake.

                            SEAN
                (Looking at Vicky for the 
                first time with his eyes 
                open)
                    Oh. Hey Vix. How's it going? What 
            do you want?

                            VICKY
                    Not good. Not good at all. Bad. 
            I've got an interview for Clifford 
            Chance, in like two days, and I 
            can't remember my fucking interview 
            speech. You promised me you'd go 
            through it today! Where were you 
            this morning?

                            SEAN
                (Sitting up, wiping some 
                of the sweat off his 
                forehead, and realising 
                he has skates on)
                    Errm. The boys and me stayed up to 
            watch the election build up last 
            night. Think we lost track of time.

                            VICKY
                    So why are you wearing a tutu? 

                            SEAN
                    I think it had something to do with 
            satirising the Republican candidate 
            for Delaware.

                            VICKY
                (Not impressed but 
                starting to be won over 
                by Sean's predicament)
                    And the skates?

                            SEAN
                    There's no rational explanation for 
            them. We were doing house Super G.

                            VICKY
                (Now smiling)
                    Well. Fuck. I had no idea you were 
            so busy today. If I had known I 
            would have come round after the 
            morning's skiing was over.

                            SEAN
                    That's ok. The snow's been a little 
            unpredictable for this year's 
            season. You weren't to know. Sorry 
            babe.

                            VICKY
                (Laughing)
                    That's ok Bodi Miller. Shit. How'd 
            it go yesterday with OC&C?

                            SEAN
                (Perking up a bit, trying 
                to put on a bit of a 
                positive show for Vicky)
                    Not too bad, yeah good actually.

                    

                            VICKY
                (Obviously interested in 
                this)
                    Yeah?

                            SEAN
                    Yeah. And they liked the junior 
            entrepreneur stuff I did last year.

                    

                             VICKY
                    That's awesome. Well done babe.

                            SEAN
                (Perking up more, putting 
                on more of a show)
                    And they loved the case study 
            stuff. I mean I really nailed it!

                            VICKY
                    Amazing! So when do you hear about 
            it?

                            SEAN
                    Errm. I mean they already told me I 
            didn't get through.

                            VICKY
                (Confused)
                    What?! But I thought you said it 
            went well?

                            SEAN
                    It did. It did. It was going really 
            well until they started with all 
            the interpersonal shit. Like, how 
            am I supposed to know what 'the 
            most significant moment of my life 
            was'? Like if they ask me questions 
            like that, that's pretty much a 
            guaranteed 100% that I don't want 
            to work there right? They didn't 
            make my selection. Fuck it that I 
            didn't make theirs. They didn't 
            make mine.

                            VICKY
                (Quietly, not finding his 
                rhetoric convincing)
                    They all ask those interpersonal 
            questions.

                            SEAN
                    Well. Maybe I don't want to work 
            anywhere that values that sort of 
            crap.

                            VICKY
                (Dispairing)
                    Sean, you need to stop hanging out 
            with your housemates. They're 
            wasting your potential.

                            SEAN
                (Cringes when he hears 
                the word potential)
                    What? Can you stop with this 
            bullshit already? They've got 
            nothing to do with my temporary 
            inability to get a job.

                            VICKY
                    Then why have you spent more time 
            smoking pot recently than you have 
            prepping for interviews?

                            SEAN
                    There's only so much I can do. 
            Like, I spent all last week filling 
            out fucking bullshit 
            questionnaires, personal 
            statements, and doing cell 
            interviews with automata only 2 
            years my senior. Give me a fuckin 
            break.

                            VICKY
                (Now perhaps realising 
                that she has gone too far 
                today)
                    Sorry. Babe. I just don't want to 
            see you throw away your life when 
            you have so much to offer the 
            world. I just see so so much good 
            in you, that I would hate to see 
            you waste it all. I mean Doug isn't 
            even in his 20s anymore, and he 
            still hasn't graduated! Don't you 
            think that's a bit sad?

                            SEAN
                (Defensively, starting to 
                turn away from Vicky)
                    You know that's because he caught 
            mono in his softmore year? You 
            can't blame that shit on him.

                            VICKY
                (Looking him in the eyes, 
                grabbing his hands)
                    Ok. Ok. Sorry. I didn't mean to 
            bust up your friends. I just, I 
            mean, I just love you Sean, and I 
            want the best for you. Listen, I 
            won't bring up your friends 
            anymore, and I just know that you 
            are absolutely going to nail the 
            next interview. [Pause] I'm sure of 
            it.

                            SEAN
                    You think so?

                            VICKY
                    Definitely, 100%. I mean who 
            wouldn't want the only black slope 
            thrashing, cross-dressing, 
            beachside skier in LA.

                            SEAN
                    Shall we go and grab some lunch at 
            Dani's (a bar)?

                            VICKY
                (Kissing Sean)
                    Sure.

                            
    DANI'S BAR SCENE - THE NEXT DAY

    Sean and his housemates Tone, and Nils are sitting outside 
    smoking, drinking beer. Dougie is not there.

                            NILS
                    Have you guys ever noticed how 
            Indiana Jones basically has no plot 
            influence in Raiders?

                            SEAN
                    No way. Fuck. Really?

                            NILS
                    Yeah. Jones starts out in Peru 
            trying to steal something from the 
            Incas. Completely plot unrelated. 
            He travels to the Himalayas, meets 
            the girl...what's her name?

                            SEAN
                    The actress? No fucking idea.

                            NILS
                    No the character....Mary?

                            TONE
                    It's Martha isn't it. 100%.

                            NILS
                    No it's not. There is no character 
            in Indiana Jones called 'Martha'. 
            You know fucking nothing about 
            movies, apart from that Newzealand 
            Tolkien trilogy you starred in.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing)
                    Nice.

                    Hey, come on man. Don't be 
            'precious' about it.

                            TONE
                (Unimpressed)
                    It's definitely Martha. I'm sure 
            about it.

                            NILS
                    Nope. It's not. I'll Google it.

                    Does anyone give a shit about this 
            story?

                            SEAN
                    Yeah. To be fair Nils this better 
            be Old Man and the Sea with this

                    Hemingway didn't have to deal with 
            this sort of bullshit from Gertrude 
            Stein. So he meets this girl, 
            Marion. Jones and the broad get 
            accosted by Nazis. They escape. 
            They travel to Egypt. They find the 
            Nazis, who have the grail. The two 
            of them get caught, and get put in 
            a room with a shit ton of snakes.

            fatherland without it.

                            NILS
                    So they escape. Jones finds the 
            Arc. Puts it on a boat for London. 
            Nazis retake the boat, along with 
            Jones and girl. Go to the Grecian 
            island they were originally aiming 
            for. They open the box. Faces melt. 
            Good guys win. Jones fails to 
            influence the outcome in any way.

                            TONE
                    I fucking love that part. There's

                    I didn't know he was still trying 
            with those guys? I thought everyone 
            had already passed, like 5 times, 
            on his musical horror?

                    He's moved on it seems. Weirdly,

                    Without sounding pompous, and of 
            course I want him to nail it. It's 
            like his first interview. He's 
            older than most of the faculty. I 
            wish I weren't aware of some of the 
            places he has bodily hair. I mean, 
            this place would be fucking insane 
            if they took him.

                            TONE
                    He wouldn't shower for his own

                    Should we contact his parents? Call

            from downtown. Got high with this 
            guy who was selling old cans on the 
            back of the bus. Like amazing 
            shiiit. Straight out of Peru.

                            SEAN
                (Looking at the others 
                kind of quizzically.)
                    Cool. Errrm. But how did the 
            interview go?

                            DOUGIE
                    Yeah, it was ok. I mean ok. I mean 
            it's fucking weird having to answer 
            questions and shit. You know?

                            SEAN
                    Yeah. Shit, sorry man.

                            DOUGIE
                    I mean, what is the fucking point 
            of that shiiit. 

                (Pausing. Looking at 
                Nils. Starting to smile.)
                    How is Simba's left paw? The dry 
            monsoon still continuing from 
            yesterday?

                            NILS
                (Laughing.)
                    Keep it fucking down man. Don't 
            want anyone else to hear about it.

                            DOUGIE
                (Speaking louder, 
                announcing this to the 
                table next door which is 
                full of girls.)
                    Hey guys. Like, do you like Disney 
            movies?

                            GIRLS
                (Speak amongst 
                themselves, who appear 
                originally shy)
                    Like, is this some sort of pick up 
            line?

                            DOUGIE
                    It kind of depends how much you 
            like cartoons.

                            GIRLS
                (At least one of them 
                speaks up, and might 
                ostensibly be interested 
                in engaging with them.)
                    I mean probably the Little 
            Mermaid...No Aladdin. Whole New 
            World. Like best music ever.

                            DOUGIE
                (Nils is trying to shut 
                him up the whole time 
                here. Shhing him etc.)
                    I mean. How much do you like 
            character Aladdin?

                            GIRLS
                    I mean he's ok, but I always liked 
            the genie.

                            DOUGIE
                (Excitedly, as he now has 
                her hooked.)
                    Ok. The genie. He's your fave. I 
            mean do you like him more than 
            like, your boyfriend?

                            GIRLS
                    I don't have a boyfriend. But if I 
            did, maybe. Depends if he has any 
            magical powers?

                            DOUGIE
                    Ok. Do you think you would make out 
            with him if he were real?

                            GIRLS
                    That's a fucking weird question. 
            Errm. I suppose if he were real, 
            and if he had 'magical' powers, I 
            might.

                            DOUGIE
                (Nils is burying his head 
                in his hands at this 
                point.)
                    What about if he were still a 
            cartoon? 

                            GIRLS
                (One of the girls says 
                sexily looking straight 
                at Dougie)
                    I'd probably fuck the shit out of 
            him. Cartoonistically. That is.

                            DOUGIE
                (Impressed.)
                    Shit. Ok.

                            GIRLS
                    Sorry, does that damage your 
            childhood Disney nostalgia?

                            DOUGIE
                (Impressed at the 
                forwardness of the girl)
                    No. I just. Errm. That's fucking 
            cool.

                    

    Dougie now sits back down, and everyone looks kind of 
    relieved. Especially Nils.

                            NILS
                    Thank fuck for that. You fucking 
            asshole. As well as making me 
            physically fucking sick, you scared 
            the shit out of those girls. You, 
            not me, are the sick fuck.

                            DOUGIE
                (Starts to say something, 
                but is interrupted by the 
                girl he was conversing 
                with.)
                            GIRLS
                    Like, I don't know where you got 
            that weed from, but, we are about 
            to head to this party. Think 
            there's going to be a keg, probably 
            girls which are too good for three 
            quarters of you, but....if you 
            could get us some of that shit 
            you've been smoking maybe we could 
            sort you out with a ride.

                            DOUGIE
                    Let me ask my fellow cabinet 
            ministers. Guys, what'd you think, 
            sounds good to me?

                            TONE, SEAN, NILS
                (In agreement, they nod, 
                and generally give their 
                answers positively.)
                            DOUGIE
                    Put on your overalls girls, as 
            we're about to hit this shit.

                            
    CAR SCENE - MOMENTS LATER

    The girls in the back are sandwiched by the guys nearest the 
    car doors. Tone is in the boot. Dougie is laughing, sitting 
    in the front seat, talking and laughing with the girl whom 
    he was conversing before. He's making some sort of joint 
    with a big bag of weed strewn out on his lap. Nils and Sean 
    are looking a bit sheepish, especially Sean who is next to a 
    larger girl who seems enraptured by him, and is nausing him 
    off. Nils is trying to speak with one of the hotter two, but 
    is being interrupted by Tone from behind them.

                            DOUGIE
                    Yeah, so you like study here?

                            GIRL 1
                    No, I'm over at UCLA, majoring in 
            psychology. 

                            DOUGIE
                    Ahh. Cool. Like I love that shit. 
            Like when I'm watching an advert 
            with Megan Fox drinking Mountain 
            Dew. 15 minutes later I find myself 
            in a 7/11, got 2 bucks in my 
            pocket, what am I going to spend it 
            on? I mean I don't even like the 
            stuff, but that's psychology for 
            you.

                            GIRL 1
                (Laughing.)
                    Yeah I mean I am just trying to 
            work out ways to sell shit 
            subliminally to people. 

                            DOUGIE
                    Ok. So we need to work out what to 
            start selling. What has a good 
            margin on it? Spiritual guidance of 
            some kind is pretty cheap to make. 
            Only thing is, can you actually 
            contact the dead?

                            GIRL 1
                    I think as much as John Edwards 
            can. Not as much as Hailey Joel 
            Osmond.

                            DOUGIE
                    Ok. I think that's enough 
            spirituality to make it work. 
            Actually I think there could be a 
            gap in the market. I mean there are 
            so many self-help gurus out there, 
            and shit loads of stuff for people 
            failing at life and shit. But, what 
            about a book that does the reverse? 
            Tells successful businessmen, 
            congressmen etc. which attributes 
            it takes to really suck at life?

                            GIRL 1
                    Yeah. A book aimed at reducing 
            societal inequality by bringing 
            down the overly smug.

                            GIRL 2
                (A little overweight, 
                obviously into Sean. 
                Looking at him.)
                    So, you know, I like Miley Cirus, 
            but I don't want to be her.

                            SEAN
                (Humouring, trying to be 
                a nice guy)
                    Yeah, I mean this twerking thing is 
            fucking weird. And it's now some 
            sort of 'meme'. A word that has now 
            lost all meaning due to its 
            adoption by the 
            smartphone-wielding, 
            predictive-texting, masses.

                    

                            GIRL 2
                (Not really understanding 
                Sean's point.)
                    Yeah, I mean that Harlem Shake 
            thing was good, but not AMAZING. 
            Much funnier was that planking 
            thing.

                            SEAN
                (Carrying on regardless 
                with his rant.)
                    Yeah. I mean here is a phrase 
            coined to try to understand why 
            some ideas are more tenacious than 
            others, borrowing on concepts from 
            Darwinian evolution, and now 13 
            year old kids are using it to 
            justify dancing topless outside the 
            Sagrada Familia. I mean it's all 
            just fucking media bollocks anyway. 
            Like I always think, 'when does a 
            person reported on in the news 
            transition from being injured, to 
            badly injured?' Is there like a 
            wall chart which divides up 
            injuries on the basis of 
            seriousness? Broken arm. Not 
            serious. Appendicitis. Unless 
            stoned, not serious. Paralysis. 
            Serious. 

                            GIRL 2
                    But I mean, like if someone is a 
            painter, a broken finger is 
            serious.

                            SEAN
                    Totally. I mean there's no way to 
            have an objective measure of injury 
            seriousness. It's all just media 
            pomp.

                            TONE
                (Talking to the hot girl 
                on the back left seat, 
                who's obviously not 
                interested.)
                    So, you know people always say, you 
            are what you eat?

                            NILS
                    Tone, why don't you just stop your 
            barking for once?

                (Turning to the 
                disinterested girl.)
                    I mean some guys are just so 
            insensitive you know?

                            TONE
                    Well, anyway you know how people 
            say you become whatever you eat too 
            much of?

                            NILS
                    If we ignore him long enough he'll 
            go away. He's like the cursor on a 
            laptop screen when you watch a 
            movie. If you leave him, he ceases 
            to be visible.

                            TONE
                    So, yeah. It's funny when people 
            say that, about embodying what you 
            eat. Cause I don't remember eating 
            a legend.

                (Laughing looking 
                straight at the girl from 
                the side.)
                    You get it? I mean I made that up 
            just now, on the spot.

                and sarcastically.)
                    Yeah?

                            TONE
                    I mean I pretty much make up all my 
            own material. Not to brag, but some 
            people are just innately funny. You 
            know?

                            GIRL 3
                    Yeah. Your humour is pretty much on 
            a par with George Bernard Shaw in 
            terms of witty construction.

    FRAT PARTY SCENE - NIGHT

    Dougie becomes a big hit at the party; pulling out his 
    guitar, and just hitting it off with everyone. The other 
    three just stay together and get smashed. The three are sat 
    round a table playing pyramid, coupled with mine/yours. The 
    idea behind the scene is that Sean finds out that Dougie has 
    a job, or perhaps Nils tells him about one of his childhood 
    idols who is an actor, which will give Sean advice later on. 
    Sean flips out, and gets really fucking drunk.

                    You know the game doesn't really 
            work if your sole discriminatory 
            factor for deciding between mine 
            and yourses, is the sex of the

                    Well, at least I can discriminate 
            on that basis you camp-counselor. 
            If you competed in the Olympics 
            you'd be a BI-athlete.

                            SEAN
                (Laughing.)
                    Yeah, Nils, if you were a mode of 
            transport, you'd be a BI-cycle.

                the table.)
                    Ok you apes. Three of spades. Any 
            takers?

                            TONE
                    I call the homo gaypien. 

                            NILS
                    Tone, how the fuck do you think 
            you'll get away with that? We know 
            you don't have a three after that 
            call five minutes ago! Sometimes I 
            wonder whether your life isn't just 
            one long Memento-esq movie.

                            TONE
                    Shit. Fuck.

                (Drinks two fingers of 
                vodka.)
                            SEAN
                    Did I ever tell you how I used to 
            think that movie was shit?

                            NILS
                    No. How the fuck did you think 
            that? I mean Carrie Anne Moss, 
            could have probably been adequately 
            replaced by actual moss, but 
            otherwise it was pretty sound.

                            SEAN
                    Yeah. Well I watched it in the 
            temporally-correct order. There was 
            a DVD extra that allowed you to do 
            that. Let's just say it lacks some 
            of the suspense of the original 
            intended format.

                            NILS
                    Haha. That's fucking hilarious!

    They hear Dougie starting to sing from the other room.

                            NILS
                    Why does Dougie always kill it at 
            parties like this?

    They all turn and look at Dougie, through a doorway into the 
    other room where he is playing a guitar, making people 
    laugh.

                            SEAN
                    I think he's got a certain aura 
            about him. Especially on first 
            appearances. When I met him I just 
            thought, 'This guy's got 
            everything. He's witty, 
            intelligent, neyyy, a fucking 
            genius.'

    Whilst Sean is saying this Dougie starts mimick playing the 
    guitar with his cock. Strumming the strings with his balls. 
    All the guys start to wince, and look quizzical. 

                            NILS
                    Yeah.. Erm. Is he doing his cock 
            guitar thing?

                            
                            TONE
                    Yep. I think so. I didn't think 
            he'd pull that one out of the bag 
            for, at least, another seven shots.

                            SEAN
                    Yep. As I said. Then after the 
            initial idiot savant behaviour he 
            just turns into a cock-wielding 
            idiot.

                            
    Dougie is now dancing around the room, 'playing' the guitar 
    with his cock, nipple and ass. Other people are looking at 
    him sort of half laughing, half not-really-understanding.

                            SEAN
                    God help them. They're putty in his 
            hands.

                the centre of the table.)
                    Ok. I call Sean.

                            TONE
                    I call Sean too.

                            SEAN
                    Shit guys! That's like eight 
            fingers if I call you both. 
            [Pauses] Ok. Fuck it. I call the 
            two of 'yers.

                            TONE
                    Put that in your ass, and fuck it.

                            NILS
                    A bit less coarsely than this 
            gibbon, but I'm afraid Seany, the 
            result is the same. Time to take 
            your medicine.

                            TONE
                    Yep. See you tomorrow man.

    Sean starts to drink the eight fingers of vodka from a 
    bottle, obviously finding it hard going. Stopping halfway 
    through.

                            NILS
                    Come on man. Don't worry we'll try 
            to remember some anecdotes about 
            tonight to tell you in the morning. 
            Night night.

    Sean finishes the rest of the glass, and promptly walks 
    outside, to get some fresh air. He eventually finds himself 
    in the garden, and looks up at the stars. He closes his eyes 
    and starts to breathe more slowly, collecting himself. The 
    camera starts to mimic his vision now, with the world 
    spinning and blurring. He then walks back into the house 
    smiling drunkenly to himself to find both Tone and Nils with 
    their arms round Dougie, congratulating him.

                            TONE
                (Speaking to Dougie.)
                    Fuck that means we'll both be 
            downtown next year! We can do 
            business lunches, you know? Like, 
            have a beer on Friday lunchtimes.

                            DOUGIE
                    Shit yeah, that'll be fucking 
            awesome. 

                            NILS
                    I'm only a few blocks over. We can 
            do midweek, young professional, 
            beers at some grimy LA bar.

                            SEAN
                (A little out of it, so 
                not really grasping what 
                is happening.)
                    What's happening guys? What you 
            talking about?

                            NILS
                    Dougie got some news. Dougie, why 
            don't you fill in the dear boy?

                            DOUGIE
                    Yeah, like two minutes ago I was 
            smoking this fucking jurassic 
            doobie with this guy, Darren, and I 
            was like, 'How old was Michael 
            Jordan?'

    Dougie's eyes glaze over, and he is just looking off into 
    the distance. The rest of the guys look at him, and lean in 
    closer expecting him to say something, starting to look at 
    one another.

                            NILS
                    Errm. Dougie. Like, maybe you 
            should tell Seany about the job?

                            DOUGIE
                    Oh yeah. Fuck. That was gooooodd 
            weeed. Yeah, so I was smoking this 
            joint, then I gets a call from this 
            guy at the publisher, saying that 
            the graduate editor position was 
            now filled.

                            SEAN
                    Shit. Sorry man. Well I guess there 
            will be other interviews. Other 
            chances. You probably didn't want 
            it anyway right?

                            DOUGIE
                    Yeah. At first I was like. Shiiiit. 
            Then the guy on the phone says, 
            like even though the graduate job 
            has gone, they think I could just 
            walk into a more senior role (since 
            I am a bit more experienced). So 
            they offered me the position of 
            'Assistant Editor'! 

    Sean is now starting to glaze over as the gravity of 
    Dougie's news starts to sink in. The room starts to spin, 
    and the other guys are all staring at him.

                            NILS
                (Looking at Sean who has 
                gone catatonic.)

                            DOUGIE
                    Yeah. You don't look so good man. 
            Want to bounce from here and go and 
            go have a group xtube outing back 
            at el palacio?

                            SEAN

                of psychotic.)

                    Ok. It's good that you're talking, 
            but I'm not sure whether 
            anthropomorphising alcohol is a 
            good or bad sign.

                            SEAN

                pouring a massive glass 
                of vodka for himself, and

                    Eight fingers. Eight fingers.

    Downing the drink, then proceeding to pour himself another 
    huge drink.

                            DOUGIE
                    That's it big guy. Just let it out. 
            Ok, shiit that's a lot a booze. A 
            lot.

                    Shit, he's giving Mel Gibson a run 
            for his money here.

            outta here.

                            SEAN
                (Literally grabbing 
                everything around him 
                that looks remotely 
                drinkable.)
                    You wanna run? I wanna run!

    Sean starts to run around the house, grabbing every drink he 
    can and downing it.

                            FRAT BOY
                (Sean is taking the drink 
                away from the frat boy, 
                and downing it.)
                    What the fuck you doing you little 
            prick?

                            SEAN
                (Mimicking writing notes 
                with his hand.)
                    Huh? Me?

                    Yeah you little fagg.

                            SEAN
                (Still mimicking 
                writing.)
                    Oh shit. Sorry I didn't get that 
            last one. Could you repeat it?

                            FRAT BOY
                    Get the fuck outta here you little 
            shit. [Pause] What the fuck are you 
            doing?

                            SEAN
                (Still writing.)
                    Just making sure I get these 
            witisms written down. Jesus, this 
            stuff is genuine platinum comedy. 
            Woody Allen will probably want to 
            make a screenplay, you just wait by 
            your phone for the call.

    Sean now runs, grabs the guitar, starts to use it somehow as 
    a vessel to drink from. Perhaps pouring the drink into the 
    hole, then tipping the guitar upside down into his mouth.

    Nils, Dougie, Tone are all next to each other just staring 
    blankly at Sean's descent.

                            
                            NILS

                quizzically.)
                    Shit. This is fuckin' nuts.

                            TONE
                    Yeah. Shall we intervene? I mean 
            he's pretty much asking for an ass 
            kicking.

                            DOUGIE
                (Still high, laughing.)
                    Shit, that was actually pretty 
            funny with that frat boy. Glad to 
            see that the kid has it.

                            NILS
                    Fuck it. He can be an asshole, 
            let's leave him to it.

    Sean runs past, now holding a salmon; flapping it in the 
    faces of Nils and Tone.

                            TONE
                    Where the fuck did he get a fish 
            from?

                            DOUGIE
                    Shit. Boy's resourcesful.

    Sean now starts to look a bit ill. And slows to a stop, then 
    runs up to a toilet, and voms into the beeday. Then just 
    passes out on the toilet floor, with salmon in hand still. 
    Camera fuzzes out.

                    

                    

                    

    HUNGOVER FROM PARTY - MORNING AFTER

    Sean is lying on the sofa just wearing his pants. He is 
    woken up by the pleasant sound of Dougie cooking the gil 
    from last night breakfast. They both sound jovial, and are 
    getting on like a house on fire.

                            DOUGIE
                (Speaking to Anna, the 
                girl.)
                    So, yeah. I don't exactly work out, 
            but you know, now and then I walk 
            all the way into the city. Just to 
            see the scenery, admire the 
            architecture, smoke the odd doobie?

    Sean is now kind of rubbing his eyes, not really 
    understanding what is going on, particularly finding it odd 
    that Sean is talking about architecture.

                            ANNA
                (Laughing.)
                    Well I normally just date jocks, 
            you know, guys on crew, baseball 
            pitchers, the quarterbacks. But, 
            maybe in your case - seeing as your 
            eggs benedict are quite so 
            excellent - I might be able to make 
            a small exception.

                            DOUGIE
                (Leaning over and kissing 
                Anna.)
                    Who said I wasn't a quarterback? I 
            can toss with the best of them you 
            know?

                (Now he sees Sean 
                starting to rise from the 
                sofa.)
                    Hey there, mr sleepy head, you want 
            some eggs and salmon?

                            ANNA
                (Smiling.)
                    I'm sure you could do with some 
            sustenance after last night's 
            frivolity.

                (Trying to pass her plate 
                over to Sean.)
                    Try them. Your housemate here is a 
            bit of a culinary genius. They're 
            not quite michelin star, but not 
            far off.

                            DOUGIE
                (Laughing, and talking to 
                Anna.)
                    Bullshit they're worthy of two. 
            Perhaps not three stars, but El 
            Bulli had to begin somewhere.

                (Looking at the ill 
                looking Sean now.)
                    No seriously man. You should have 
            some. I always think eggs make me 
            feel better after a night of 
            fucking some sorority girls.

                            SEAN
                (Looking shocked at 
                hearing this news.)
                    Shit. What? What the fuck?

                            ANNA
                    Yeah. My girl Cara wanted me to 
            give you this. Think she had a good 
            time last night.

                (Hands Sean a napkin with 
                a lipstick mark on it, 
                along with a number and 
                the name 'Cara'.)
                            SEAN
                (Looking at the napkin 
                and freaking out.)
                    Shit. Oh my fucking God. What did I 
            do?

                            DOUGIE
                    Don't sweat it man, like she was 
            HOT. H-O-to-the-T hot you know?

                            SEAN
                    Shit. Does Vicky know?

                            DOUGIE
                (Laughing, and looking at 
                his accomplice, Anna.)
                    Shit. I can't go along with this 
            any longer; I can't bear the 
            suffering. You were a fucking 
            ass-dick last night, but you 
            weren't a fucking ass-dick I'm 
            afraid. The pants stayed firmly 
            glued to your ballsack. Me and my 
            accomplice here just wanted to 
            freak the shit out of you. Mission 
            completed.

                (Dougie now turns and 
                high fives Anna.)
                            SEAN
                (Smiling now. Fucking 
                relieved.)
                    Fuck! Fuck, that was a good one. 
            Shit. I mean, I've never fucked a 
            sorority girl, so I don't know I 
            how I thought seven vodkas to the 
            wind would help. But, I have to 
            say, well played sirs.

                (Turning now to look at 
                Anna.)
                    Sorry, shit, I don't even remember 
            your name?

                            ANNA
                (Taking Sean's 
                outstretched hand, and 
                shaking it.)
                    Anna. UCLA student. Liar 
            extraordinaire. Nice to make your 
            acquaintance fellow knight.

                            SEAN
                (Now looking at Dougie 
                now.)
                    Shit. Like what the fuck happened? 
            I have brief memories of a lot of 
            fingers of vodka, then just 
            pleasant blackness.

    Nils and Tone now enter the house. Clearly having been 
    outside jogging, as both are wearing jogging clothes, and 
    are sweating. Especially the mildy overweight Tone.

                            TONE
                    Ah. Glad to see that Captain 
            Cumstain is now past the morning 
            wood stage. You look like Sigourney 
            Weaver in Aliens 3. Remember much 
            from last night friend?

                            DOUGIE
                    We just walked the sailor along the 
            plank, and was about to debrief him 
            when you two sweaty fucks strolled 
            in.

                            NILS
                (Looking at Sean.)
                    Shit. You were badass last night 
            Seany. Remember fucking that 
            sorority chick?

                            DOUGIE
                    I'm afraid that story has already 
            broke. Anna's potty mouth was 
            sufficient to convince the dear 
            boy.

                            TONE
                    Faaacck. I would have loved to have 
            seen that. Oh well. Maybe next time 
            you are the last person in our 
            friendship group to secure a job; 
            you go on a drunken fuck rage, and 
            wake hungover from shit, we can do 
            it again.

                            DOUGIE
                    Shit. Tone. Just because you look 
            like an out of shape Jabba the Hut, 
            dressed up as a drug dealer, go 
            easy on the boy.

                            TONE
                    You lazy fuck. We've just been 
            jogging. A word you mightn't be 
            acquainted with.

                            SEAN
                    Shit, sorry about that last night 
            man. I remember now. Good fucking 
            work on getting the job. Sorry I 
            reacted like Christian Bale on the 
            set of some shit sci fi movie.

                            DOUGIE
                (High fiving Sean, and 
                laughing.)
                    No worries my man. Just chill out. 
            If me and these crack addicts can 
            get a job, there's hope for you 
            yet!

                            SEAN
                (Laughing.)
                    Yeah. Good point! Now about time I 
            found some clothes. Shit. I bet Vix 
            has texted me like a thousand 
            times, so I should probably try and 
            find my phone.

    Tone rolls his eyes and looks at the other two. It is clear 
    that Vicky isn't necessarily the most popular person in the 
    house.

                            NILS
                    Ah don't worry about that man. We 
            saw her when we were out running. 
            Told her you'd just been up all 
            night studying for the interview on 
            Friday. She bought it.

                            SEAN
                    Awesome. Cheers boys. Much 
            appreciated. I owe you.

                            TONE
                    Yeah you do gay. Tomorrow night at 
            Rick's you get us all, like two 
            beers.

                            SEAN
                    Done. Mercenaries make the best 
            soldiers.

                (Now purposely Sean 
                starts collecting his 
                clothes, and putting them 
                on quickly as if he is 
                going somewhere.)
                            TONE
                    Where you off to in such a hurry? 
            You know Vicky is good right?

                            SEAN
                    Gentlemen, and

                (Looking at Anna.)
                    Fair maiden, I am afraid to say 
            that I have some work to do.

    Sean walks out of the room, leaving the others.

                            TONE
                    What a English Cigarette? Where's 
            he off to?

                            NILS
                    Prepare for his interview you 
            schoolboy fucker. You are such a 
            fucking crass moron sometimes you 
            know?

                            ANNA
                    Yeah, I suppose you are above that 
            sort of immature stuff Nils right?

                            NILS
                (A little bit unsure as 
                to what is going on as he 
                doesn't even know this 
                girl really.)
                    Err. Yeah. I mean mostly.

                            ANNA
                    Cool. Yeah I suppose whacking off 
            to a couple of cartoon Lions is 
            pretty adult.

    The other two guys just crack up laughing at this point, 
    with Anna smiling.

                            NILS
                (Looking straight at 
                Dougie.)
                    You fucker! You promised me you 
            wouldn't tell anyone.

                            DOUGIE
                (Laughing.)
                    I didn't. I told Anna. She's now 
            one of us I'm pleased to say.

    Nils walks out of the room in a huff, leaving the others 
    just cracking up.

                            DOUGIE
                (Moving over to Anna, and 
                hugging and kissing her.)
                    Well played there. Are there any 
            limits to your talents?

                            ANNA
                    Well, that's strike two. Want to go 
            up to the room to see if we can 
            make it a Turkey?

    Anna and Dougie then holding hands run outside the room 
    holding each other's hands.

                            TONE
                (Looking disgusted.)
                    Arrhh. For fuck's sake you guys.

                (He now sees that Anna 
                has left some of the Eggs 
                and Salmon on her plate, 
                and picks it up and 
                tastes it.)
                    Not bad. Not bad at all.

                (Now takes the food from 
                both plates and sits down 
                and begins to eat it.)
    MONTAGE OF SEAN WORKING ON HIS APPLICATIONS

    Scene of Sean reading, writing, surfing the website of the 
    company he has the interview with. He starts nodding off to 
    sleep at some point, then catches himself, goes and has a 
    shower, comes back into camera dressed in a suit, perhaps 
    the day after, and practising his personal statement stuff 
    into the mirror. The scene then moves to Sean sitting in a 
    room with a load of other candidates, writing some sort of 
    test. The scene ends with a roll call of all the first stage 
    successful candidates having their names read out in a room 
    by a stern looking HR lady. Sean is sitting there with his 
    fingers crossed, obviously very nervous. He is ecstatic when 
    his name actually gets read out. The montage scene ends with 
    the voice of Sean's interviewer asking Sean a question.

    INTERVIEW SCENE WITH COMPANY

    This is the final interview with a partner from the company 
    to which Sean is applying. He gets asked some interpersonal 
    question that he has practised. Perhaps referencing the 
    'what is your most significant moment?' The partner then 
    looks down, quietly reading Sean's CV, and Sean thinks the 
    worst. The interviewer then offers Sean a job then and 
    there. Sean holds it together, and shakes his hand. He 
    leaves the company then just jumps up and fist pumps a 
    policeman. Then apologises. 

    SEAN AND VICKY LOOKING ROUND APARTMENTS

    Sean and Vicky are looking round apartments in a nice part 
    of the city. Sean is really easy going about them. Vicky is 
    not. Sean is a bit uncertain about the price, but agrees in 
    order to keep Vicky happy. They then move in their stuff 
    ahead of Sean starting work on the training week the day 
    after.
